23-Apr-20,"""Hey, I've got a story of a man with mental health problems who falls through the cracks of an overwhelmed system, snaps and starts killing people."" ""Hmmm, no one is brave enough to fund a production unless it's a superhero movie."" ""Ok, I think I can make this work...""",Bill T,3.5
23-Apr-20,"Joker is a billion + dollar validation of the over-arching ethos in today's society: ""I am a victim"". For folks who work hard every day on internal locus of control, personal responsibility and (despite the pain and suffering that is guaranteed in this life for ALL of us) maintaining a sense of gratitude and hopeful perseverance, it should be a shrill and disturbing alarm that this film receives seemingly universal praise amidst even louder righteous acquittal of the main character's murderous vengeance. Worse, one reviewer on another site decreed everyone in the world EXCEPT the Joker needs to be a better person. Particularly those of us who can't ""relate"" to feeling alone and isolated. This is the same mentality that would put the blame on ""mean people"" or society in general, and then specifically on a mental health professional rather than the individual who decided to go out and murder. Victim stance is far worse than a distorted, personal-responsibility-absolving crutch, it is a powerful, addictive, debilitating narcotic already being mass produced/consumed in our present society. And this film is one of the dealers.",Lonnie M,0.5
22-Apr-20,"I don't understand the people who didn't like the movie. Let's start first with Joaquin Phoenix's performance as ""The Joker"", not only did he put so much detail to every small expression on his face and every tone in his voice he also captured perfectly the body language of a schizophrenic person. Also the role of the Joker to begin with is really hard since you really need to get into the mind of a mentally ill person which is never an easy task espiciely if that person is the Joker. Now let's get to the writing, the plot was bulid very well into the psycholegy of the Joker and to a point where you see the view from his eyes and also makes you question like a person with schizophrenia what is a the reality and what isn't. The entire point in this movie is to leave Joker's past a multiple choice, just like said in the comics by the Joker himself and I quote "" I'm not exactly sure what happened. Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"", by that we can understand why he doesn't remember his past do to his fight with his schizophrenia and with his reality that constantly switches. The movie is a true masterpiece that literally gives us a deep dive into the world of madness and dream of normality showing us the more human sides of Joker and not just his crazy killer psychotic persona in a more complexed and explaining way .",Yana S,5

22-Apr-20,"Masterpiece. From Joaquin's incredible performance to the amazing and smart story-telling, this movie is a masterpiece. You know people who judged Joaquin's role and said they preferred seeing Heath Ledger as Joker are wrong. Don't get me wrong Heath was an iconic Joker character he deserves all fans, but some critics didn't really get this movie's main idea. I say both of them did an amazing job acting as Joker. Heath Ledger as the famous comic book Joker , enjoyed by kids and teens. And Joaquin as the psycho mental ill Joker, who was affected by people around him and how they treated him. I think what the script and director wanted to focus on was not only Joker character, but actually what comes out of any mentally unstable person who has been bullied in his life like that. This is an awesome movie with an emotional message for us all. And it's definitely a must-see!",Layale L,4

18-Apr-20,"At first, I didn't know whether I should have booked tickets to watch Joker because I heard mixed reviews but I'm glad I went to see Joker because I absolutely loved it and so did my mates that I went with. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal as Arthur Fleck, a middle aged man who is lonely and lives with his mother in a very unhealthy house, Arthur Fleck symbolises the lower class in society as he realises that Gotham is decaying and it effects him very badly as we see throughout the film how he starts to lose his sanity and becomes the Joker or a Joker like character, it was very emotional seeing what Arthur has to go through in this film. Thomas Wayne represents the upper class in society as he is a rich man who has a wealthy lifestyle and only cares about the rich. Arthur starts a revolt against the upper class which leads to people from the lower class joining forces and going after Thomas Wayne and the upper class. Todd Phillips did a brilliant job at depicting todays society through a case study of the Joker, the Joker is a brilliant example of a lower class person as in The Killing Joke comic, he is poor and is a failed comedian. Joker is a must see and it is in my top 10 list of favourite films, the score is chilling and on point thanks to Hildur Gutnadottir, the atmosphere is created perfectly by making it eerie, the acting is marvellous and I declare this film a masterpiece because in my opinion, this film doesn't have any flaws and I enjoyed every minute of it.",Oliver K,5
18-Apr-20,"Joker was a mind blowing movie to me. From the performances, the score...the everything all make this movie something really awesome!",Cody R,4
14-Apr-20,Dark but brilliant storytelling with a disturbingly memorable performance by Mr. Phoenix.,Josh C,4
13-Apr-20,This is an incredible movie that everyone must watch. It's just an emotional roller coaster and seeing Arthur trying to be a good guy but the world hates him so he turns into his alter ego Joker and becomes a new person and gets praised for everything he did afterwords. I just absolutely love this movie and will definitely recommend it!,Ty S,5
13-Apr-20,"This movie is good to look at. The lighting and colour schemes are pleasant to the eye. The problem starts when the viewer starts to dig into them for meaning. In the first 45 minutes or so, it is easy to define what's real and what's a segment of Arthur's imagination. I can comprehend Phillips' vision. As Arthur's mental health gets worse, the world gets more confusing and he can no longer separate the reality from his fantasies. But... Honestly, things could get more creative than messing with lightning and colours. 2) The script is one word: Boring. Noone sounds real. They are either overdramatic or plain dull. Empty words which can not convey any other emotion, rather than hatred or immense emotional pain. The storyline was dumb. I understand society despises people, especially those who are different in any way, shape or form, being that physical or mental, but in this movie, this is done so aggressively that I think it causes even more damage. 3) Yes, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor, but did he deserve all the awards he got for this particular part? No. He has been in so many other movies, in which his acting was much more organic, much more intense, much more human. The only thing this movie is trying so hard to convey is proving that Arthur is human. Phoenix, in my opinion, fails that task. The acting of the others is solid, but not special. Nothing striking, nothing that ticks in this movies, in terms of acting. 4) The message that this movie tries to convey is good. It tries to change the world for the better, no one can criticise that. It is extremely challenging to write from the perspective of a person living with a mental illness, but it can be done and it can be done immensely well. I suggest you watch one movie, which writing has left me speechless called ""Mary and Max"".",joe e,2
13-Apr-20,This movie is the definition of cinema. Phoenix was great as Arthur and the story was amazing. You can really tell Arthur's life just really sucked and how his mental illness makes his life even worse. And the ending was amazing cause it wants you to question the movie afterwards.,Kendall C,5
12-Apr-20,"This film accomplishes an incredible task - making a cartoonish supervillian, hell-bent on destruction for destruction's sake, a perfectly believable character. Phoenix's performance is often agonizing to watch, but I certainly couldn't take my eyes away.",John W,5

11-Apr-20,Fantastic! Very very well directed.,Chris A,5
10-Apr-20,"This movie is great! Joaquin is incredible. Im really glad they decided to proceed with making a darker and more adult Joker film. The Joker is a disturbed character and although the appeal of Batman reaches a wide age range, Im so glad they made a movie for the adults. Between this film and the Deadpool series, rated R comic movies have proven they can be successful and deserve a place amongst all these comic book movies. Not every comic book movie needs to be for children, especially given there are probably more adult comic fans at this point than children. Only things that I didnt like The use of Rock n Roll pt 2 during the infamous staircase scene. Not for any PC reason due to Gary Glitters song being involved, but because I didnt feel like it matched the feel of the movie nor any of the other music played throughout. It felt, noticeable out of place and from a different decade, I thought it was odd. The other thing was the CGI blood, especially during the climactic scene, it just doesnt look right and bothers me when I see it in movies. Too shiny and reflective, doesnt seem to run correctly. Just use actual fake blood, CGI always looks fake and out of place, real props are always better.",Brady H,4.5
09-Apr-20,A simply mesmorising performance.,Cassie W,5
09-Apr-20,"As expected from the small teaser we saw posted by Todd Phillips all that time ago, this movie is a masterpiece. And I am disgusted and disappointed that a movie as stupid and childish as Trolls: World Tour can get a higher percentage as this. Don't expect a big budget and high action superhero film when coming into this, expect a slow and steady character peice of a man going through mental illness. This is a fantastic psychological movie rather than a movie of the superhero genre, I feel if this wasn't DC, it would still be fantastic and popular. Don't criticize it because you were expecting a big budget fuckfest of a superhero movie, this is truly as good as you can get from a modern film these days. The acting from Joaquin Phoenix is some of the best you can see, properly showing the pain in his uncontrollable laughter, and the process of a man slowly going from a man trying to get through life in a terrible situation we call society to a sociopath killer who kills to give people what he believes they deserve is fantastic and beautiful to see as it goes on. I believe this film should and probably will go down as a classic for generations.",Will H,5

08-Apr-20,If it wasn't for the makeup and names you really wouldn't be able to tell it apart from the typical 'making of killer' films out there. It's a good movie but if you're expecting it to fully live up to the hype - don't get your job on it. Two factors made it an above average film: 1. Joaquin's incredible performance 2. The Murray scene Just try and prevent yourself from becoming the cringy preteen who believes swears they can relate to the joker and you'll be fine.,Maya L,3
07-Apr-20,"Brilliant film, I really love it and continue to watch it. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic in it, never really paid much attention to him before but he's seriously good in this. And hot too, which is always a good thing. Thought it would be one of those awful superhero type films so was so pleased it wasn't. It was kind of sad though, but then it ended happily for Arthur Fleck when he turned into the hottest Joker ever seen. Hurrah.",Kate W,5

05-Apr-20,"Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake.

03-Apr-20,"Not sure how the 'critics' manage to be so consistently wrong on rotten tomatoes? This movie is an absolute masterpiece, it is perfectly paced, and the Joker is brilliantly developed through the superb script, filming and of course Phoenix who delivers an incredible performance. This is a film everyone should see it is so well made and the story so well told. My biggest complaint would be the way a young Bruce Wayne is shoehorned into the story where he doesn't really need to be, this also throws the age difference between Joker and Batman into question when they've previously been contemporaries, a bit confusing and didn't add much to the plot.",Arthur N,5

02-Apr-20,This is a must see if for no other reason Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Had he not won an Oscar it would have been a crime. Beyond that amazing performance the fact it didn't consist of 100 minutes of CGI effects and over the top fight scenes makes this a refreshing alternative to the typical comic based superhero movie.,Kurtis R,5

02-Apr-20,"I had high hopes for this film, but like many things coming out of Hollywood these days it seemed overdone, insipid and dross. I can't help but ask myself - where is the story? All I saw was a man having bad days, who eventually became an invented persona of his own envisioning. Joaquin Phoenix's Joker was overplayed and lacked depth which cuts the complexity and dimension that this character deserves. There are some good performances in this film that help bring realism to things, and the cinematography is fantastic, vivid and compares to 20's noir. However, while we learned about the character's mother and an inkling of what his early childhood was like with her, there's no origin story worth your time. I saw more imitation of art than artistic effort here. The music score was cool, good actors like DeNiro and Frances Conroy but it fell short on many, many levels.",kittycat2017,2

01-Apr-20,"�Joker' follows the story of Arthur Fleck, a troubled amateur comedian who is constantly beaten down by society, driving his transformation into the iconic comic book villain, Joker. With a great lead performance, good sense of atmosphere, an original score and pleasing visual style it is unfortunately let down by the script. Presenting underdeveloped themes, cheesy dialogue, cartoonish logic and poorly written characters. What is ultimately a slightly above average film has fueled debate and division among film fans. �Joker' is a good movie. Kind of. It is entertaining on a first viewing but the more you think about the film, the less valuable it becomes, and the more issues start to arise. Joaquin Phoenix is without a doubt the film's greatest strength, he is one of the finest actors working today and while this is not his best performance it is still very good. After winning best actor at the Academy Awards it is likely that this will be the performance that most audience members come to know him for. Phoenix portrays the underlying sinister nature of Arthur as well as evoking pathos for his traumatic experience, making Arthur a character that is simultaneously pitied and feared. In addition to provoking emotion Phoenix brings gravitas to the roll, elevating what could have been comical dialogue in the hands of a lesser actor and giving it a sense of weight and believability. More stylish than most comic book adaptations, the film's design feels grimy and lived in, the period aesthetic bolstering the idea that Gotham city is run down, and the society locked in a negative cycle. The filth that festers and spreads through Arthur's world is captured for the screen with well composed cinematography. The colour, high contrast lighting, and effective use of shallow focus gives the frame a pleasing visual texture. The obvious attention to detail from DOP Lawrence Sher imbues the film with an artistic integrity often lost in a genre saturated by creatively stifled corporate products. The award-winning score from Hildur Gu�nad�ttir also deserves mention, with boldness and originality it is effective and emotive, carrying much of the film's tonal weight, picking up the slack where the writing falls short. The downfall of this film is the writing. The first half of the film is comically mean to the point of absurdity. Burdened by a very slow first act with little plot, the audience are subjected to a repetitive loop of Arthur being beaten down both figuratively and literally. It is effective in presenting Arthur as a victim of his circumstances however the excess of his suffering makes it unbelievable. Accompanied by the lack of narrative progression, it comes across as the writers stopping the story to over explain the idea that society made Arthur the way he is. The film is plagued with obvious writing lacking any complexity or subtly. The movie presents in a very self-serious manner but doesn't follow through with a clever plot or nuanced themes. There is plenty going on, but nothing is sufficiently developed. For instance, the social uprising that is sparked by the Joker is unearned. While there is clearly a class divide in Gotham there is a lack of build-up and no attempt from the screen writers to delve deeper into why the class divide exists, or what it is either side of the divide wants. But perhaps the plot doesn't need to be amazing, if it's a character study then the characterisation and character arc should be strong enough to carry the movie. Right? Writer/director Todd Phillips claims �Joker' is a character study. However, it is difficult to write a compelling character study with a passive protagonist, one whose goals or actions are not the driving force of the plot. Arthur's lack of action comes as a result of his lack of clearly defined goals. Without a strong motivation he ends up reacting to the plot rather than driving it. This makes for a less compelling lead character and limits the opportunity for the writers to provide commentary on Arthur's intentions. So, where does the film sit morally? Arthur is clearly presented as a victim, and with practically all the other characters being exceedingly mean or evil, his violence seems to be justified. Presenting Arthur's violent outburst as his �hero moment' and not providing an in-text counter voice of reason is somewhat morally irresponsible from the script and is further evidence of the lack of complexity. The film is angry at the world but not sure why it's angry or how to fix it. It is important to note that the film is not directly condoning violence, the performance from Phoenix and the score work in tandem to convey that these are the horrific acts of a delusional man. But, the openness of the film's message call into question what it was Todd Phillips was trying to say with this movie. The film becomes a kind of blank slate where audience members can project their own thesis statement about the broad issues the film identifies. For a more believable and morally complex world the film should offer a strong counter to Arthur. Yes, the film is from Arthur's subjective point of view but that shouldn't prevent the film from presenting an opposing view to his. While we as an audience will see the same things Arthur sees, how we see those things can still be different. A believable and complex world is not a necessity for good story telling, but if a film presents itself with the gritty self-importance that �Joker' does then it should follow through with a more mature execution. While ultimately audience takeaway is more important than authorial intent there is still valid criticism in the film's execution of its goals. Why tell this story in a Joker origin movie? Obviously, the cynical reason is because comic book movies are some of the most successful and recognisable IP in Hollywood. The inclusion of comic book references such as the Wayne family feel forced and unnecessary having very little baring on the story and serving little purpose outside of the tenuous connection to the source material. There is nothing wrong with bending the source material to fit the story you want to tell but this film is trying so hard to be a �real' movie that the comic book elements feel out of place and the film would have been stronger as an original concept. There is, however, a strong crutch provided by the source material that the film can sneakily lean on. We as an audience know that the Joker is supposed to be the bad guy and we know that Arthur is eventually going to snap and take that dive into comic book villainy. Phillips takes advantage of this giving the film a palpable, yet cheap, sense of anticipation. With all this in mind �Joker' will for some people be well-crafted and entertaining, for others it will be thematically messy and problematic, and for some the film may be a deeply provocative character study that shines a light on class segregation and mental illness. Any of these reactions are justifiable when discussing the subjective nature of cinema. But, perhaps each of these different interpretations would benefit from a more critical analysis and a consideration of other perspectives, re-assessing the film's intent and success.",Harrison W,3
31-Mar-20,"An absolute 'must see movie' - ideally twice. The layers of story, actors' performance and intensity of livid mental health burden on human's life and soul in this movie was presented astonishingly.

31-Mar-20,"EXCELLENT MOVIE! I absolutely LOVE this entire movie and every aspect of it. I do not consider this movie to have any negatives (however, it does have Mature Language and Violence that I would strongly recommend parents to seriously consider if the potential positive influences/messages in the movie justify allowing even their teenagers from watching). I have been a Batman fan since I was a young child and I've read some great Batman & Joker comic books over the years and I greatly appreciated how this movie was able to create an accurate true to the comics depiction of the Joker and executed the telling of a unique yet perfect Joker origin story. Out of all the Joker origin stories I think this movie's origin explanation is by far the best, perfect and most thoroughly thought out and explained in a realistic potentially possible story. I loved the time period chosen for this film and the Joker's suit at the climax of the movie is spot on to how the Joker's suit looked in the comics made during the same time period as the movie was set in. I have absolutely no complaints with this movie. The time length was perfect and not too long. WATCH IT--with other adults, especially Batman/Joker fans who prefer the more realistic and potentially possible stories & characters that are set in a world that operates in the same way as our actual world in real life. Joker is easily my most favorite movie of the past few years at least and it is definitely in my top 10 movies of all time. Joker is simply AMAZINGLY OUTSTANDING.",Keith H,5
31-Mar-20,"Joker brings more depth to the classic villain generations of DC lovers loved to hate in a very emotional way - a way to shed light on how villains evolve to be what they are - that the world is far from black & white. It gives you sympathy for the Joker, especially since Batman's father was one of the best people who treated him like a pariah. He was never accepted, mainly for that he was poor and abused. When he realized he had nothing to lose, he decided to make his life a ""living comedy"" by killing the people he found awful - but spared the lives of those who were good to him. When he became a cult leader, he finally got the attention he deserved, whether it was ill-gotten or not.",John H,5
30-Mar-20,"This movie is something DC and comic fans have been waiting for, for a while. Between being acted well and visually pleasing, which isn't a common thing in a lot of DC films, you genuinely feel the deviation from all the characters and are able to understand why and how the Joker became the Joker. The only thing I personally felt I wanted more of was chaos, however adding too much would've drawn back from the movies more realistic tone, so I understand why they didn't do that.",Marina C,4.5

The movie deepens into the human mind and the consequences of the past and present decisions and actions upon a character. Great visuals and cinematography of a Gotham in the 1980s submerged into urban chaos. You can appreciate the detailed way in which the movie was filmed, the angles, and you can certainly recognize the geniality on every scene.

I have depression and severe anxiety and honestly this movie helped me, because it showed me that i'm not alone. I was never really a big fan of the Batman movies, but THIS is something else, it's more realistic which i prefer.

27-Mar-20,Too good.. Just a masterpice... Sadly not every one gets it and if you watch it one time or just watch the trailer you could just say is not even a DC movie... But these critiques are wrong and is a punch to the face that we need from time to time but again sadly movies are too afraid to do. Joaquin is a great actor and he totally deserved this Oscar for showing us so much emotion and he just made us see how you can be a good man but just one day may change your whole life.. I think the biggest think media doesn't get is that this is not trying to make us violent but to show us how violente is made... There is so many things in this movie that just 1 time seeing it wouldn't make you see all the big picture if you don't know much about the DC universe. 10/10 one of a few movies that can get such a score and i am really disappointed in seeing so bad ratting... Rotten tomato is now just a joke that the mentaly ill loner the Joker may think in his sick head,Edi S,5
27-Mar-20,"7.5/10. Generally speaking a good story as well as a nicely crafted film. The only real issue to me at least is it didn't necessarily feel groundbreaking like most people.

But when the full trailer was released I was kind of disappointed, thought they showed most of the good things in the movie to make the teaser and the trailer to use them as cheap baits. I was fed up by it's hype and stuff, people just saying that it will be a masterpiece and sh*t even before the film was released. But then I saw the film. I won't judge it by it's quality but how it impacted me emotionally. I can really relate to the things shown in the film and that's why I really feel the film, everytime I watch it. The way it depict Arthur's selfish personality, his self petty, how he watches the world from a third person perspective, the subtitle details of the plot, the idea of multiple interpretation, I just love it. People who can relate to it's consepts should love this film I think.",Md. A,5
27-Mar-20,"I didn't like it. I am usually a Joker fan. I guess I am used to, and prefer the more campy (Cesar Romaro, Jack Nicholson) versions of The Joker. This one was too dark. Joaquin was horrible. The movie was trash.",Lisa M,1

26-Mar-20,there are no words to describe how much I liked this movie,Renaldo Dias J,5
26-Mar-20,"What happened to the film industry in recent years? They give the oscar to one of the worst Joker because there is none actor that can be compared to him. Joker is a very deep and unpredictable character and all actors who take on this role must sacrifice. But losing 20 pounds or locking yourself in a room, going to a mental institution, ... can't make a perfect Joker. Jokers cannot reach perfection if the actor is not a joker himself ( this guy doesn't even know how to joke btw), they only act as the Joker. I personally think this is one of the worst joker roles. All I see is an actor trying to be a joker, not completely into this character. What a waste of such a highly artistic work. I respect any actor's work but I respect the characters more. That is why Marvel movies are just for high school kids now. All famous actors but no one brings his/her character no at the next level. Just bunches of Superheros fight back and forth and everyone knows good-side is gonna win. Give me back Anton Chigurh , Joker ( Darknight), Hannibal Lecter,...People care too much about how nice how real Joaquin Phoenix in real life. But his Joker is, to be honest, not on that level.",Hong T,3
24-Mar-20,"This director knows what he's doing! Most directors just do boring directing and this director wants to be up and close and I do not like that! I do understand that it is powerful directing and I respect that! Even though I wasn't 100% into the movie, the directing really is something to watch! Disturbing movie, though.",Alex C,5

23-Mar-20,"Joaquin was really good, although, he was better in ""You Were Never Really Here"" (which, if you liked him in ""Joker,"" you absolutely need to see). The rest of the movie was garbage. Completely miscast DeNiro, he is great a many roles but not this one. Zazie had no role here either, it was like someone said, ""Hey we need a female in this movie, don't we?"" (Obviously Martin Scorsese was not involved in this film.) ""Plot"" was... well it didn't have one. The ending was like, ""We ran out of film, let's stop now.""

20-Mar-20,"Brilliant, creepy, dark, moody. This is an experience, not just a movie. A great attempt at the anti-hero concept, and Phoenix makes you really try to understand Fleck's mind, which, of course, you can't because it's insane. The choice of Gotham City in 1981 is an interesting one, the atmosphere is just out of time enough to give it a alien feel (phone booths, no cell phones, graffiti covered trains).",Bill P,5
20-Mar-20,"I think I will never understand why the media decided to hit Joker like this. The film never deserved this! And Todd didn't deserve the critics they got from the media and ""critics.""

12-Mar-20,"Ladies & Gentlemen... ?? My 50th Review! ?? Today's Viewing: ""Joker"". Based On Characters From DC Comics & From The Director Who Brought You ""Road Trip"" (2000), This Psychological Thriller Just Came Out Last Year, & I Love The Idea How We Go Into The Backstory Of The Killer Clown We All Know From The ""Batman"" Comics. Joaquin Phoenix's Portrayal Of The Title Character Is Just As Amazing As The Late Heath Ledger In ""The Dark Knight"" (2008); His Performance Really Hypnotizes The Viewer. And I Love How This Film Sets Itself Up As A Character Study That Goes From Bad To Worse. However, I've Heard This Film Got Criticized For Being Extremely Violent & It Rips Off Films Like ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) & Such, But The 1st Part I Believe Is Some Folks Haven't Even Read The Comics, & The 2nd Part Is That I'd See It As A Subtle Little Wink To ""Taxi Driver"", Actually. I Mean, This Movie Can Be Fucked-Up-Scarey, Thrilling & Violent, But I Don't See That Much Violence Compared To A ""Batman"" Film Like ""The Dark Knight"". And The Joker Himself Used To Be Vague About His Past, Which Actually Does Make A Great Opportunity To Execute A Joker Backstory Film. And There Are Plenty Of Scenes Where I Predicted Something Was Gonna Happen; This Movie, Like, Pretty Much Read My Mind, Or Just A Coincidence, It Makes Me Laugh. ? As A Film Based On The Famous ""Batman"" Villain Of All, I Like This One. Sure It May Not Be ""The Dark Knight, Or ""Batman"" (1989), But ""Joker"" Is A Psychologically Thrilling & Fascinating Movie To Watch, Even Though I Can See The Ups & Downs Of The Film's Execution. But Overall, I'd Say It's Definitely Worth A Watch.",Dalton T,3.5

10-Mar-20,The often eerie 'Joker' was the latest selection for Hubby and Wife Date Night and it played to mixed reviews. Hubby loved the Joaquin Phoenix performance and not much else. What was the point? Perhaps it was to steal from a lot of other legendary movies under the guise of the DC universe. Co-writer and director Todd Phillips has disdain for his audience. He needs to take you by the hand and explain every detail instead of letting the audience interpret the film. It's frustrating. The first hour of the Joker origin story is a drag. Wife loved it. Just became enveloped in the story and enjoyed it thoroughly. A performance can carry a movie and Phoenix carries an otherwise ordinary movie. It's beautifully filmed and flies by. Hubby: 4.6/Wife: 8.2 Average Final Score: 6.4/10,Tim M,3
10-Mar-20,"The performances are superb and really keep the movie afloat. I loved the dark twist the director took on the Joker character, and Phoenix portrayed the villain exactly how a dark Joker should be portrayed.",Ben C,4
09-Mar-20,"I'd like to hear what Martin Scorsese, who famously derides comic-book adaptations, would have to say about this joyless amalgam of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Brutish, dull and derivative. Todd Phillips sucks any redeeming narrative off the screen while goading Joaquin Phoenix into paroxysms of self-indulgent nihilism. There is nothing about this film that inspires or even offends. Just a slavish commitment to the downward spiral with a twist that only the most committed Shyamalan fanboy could admire. And Jesus Christ, DeNiro. You can say ""no"" once in a while. Nobody will fault you.",tim r,1.5

09-Mar-20,"Joker: an amazing movie... by accident. ""The movie makes it look like he's starting a revolution, where the rich are taken down, the poor get everything they need and deserve, and the sad guys who can't get a date become heroes."" Time ""The movie lionizes and glamorizes Arthur even as it shakes its head, faux-sorrowfully, over his violent behavior."" Time ""In real life, we're surrounded by Arthur Flecks"". The Washington Examiner ""For (Joker) it is essentially a depiction of what happens when white supremacy is left unchecked."" The New York Times. ""Joker has quite a lot to say about society's current obsession with media and content consumption"" Comicbook ""it leaves the vulnerable to suffer without the resources they need, and the horrific consequences for the rest of society that can result."" The Guardian ""Joker is a deeply moral movie about the power of kindness"" NME ""The film is a critique not only of a social mindset, but, by exploring the motivations of the extremely wealthy Thomas Wayne, of the overall social class system"" Daily Nebraskan ""It's about breaking all the rules"" Tasha Robinson ""Joker is a mirror of American reality"" Michael Moore Without a doubt, this movie, directed by Todd Phillips and produced by DC has something special: it renovates completely the comic character of the joker into this psychedelic, internal, reflective tale, that really makes us feel, I'm not sure what, but something. First the easy parts: -The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is simply amazing, it's a really compelling act, that really makes you understand the character completely and feel its pain. I was really amazed with how his laugh actually hurt me. In general the acting gives the movie a great strength and a particular voice that wouldn't be achieved otherwise. -Secondly, the cinematography. The looks achieved by Phillips and Lawrence Sher of the movie are just beautiful, and there are some shots that make you feel very uncomfortable and accomplish their goals perfectly. There's a lot of movement and storytelling going on just in the cinematography itself. -Thirdly, but not less important, actually pretty important, is the score, written by Hildur Gu�nad�ttir is simply the most amazing thing I've ever herd. The power of it is mesmerizing, and the way it makes you feel is priceless. How she uses the cello in such a strong way is really captivating, and, in my opinion, without that amazing score, the movie wouldn't be nearly as good as it ended up being. The difficult part of this movie to analize is non other than the story itself, the core of it. In my personal beliefs, the story, and what it transmits, are the two most important factos of a movie, and the entire purpose of it lies there. So if there is something wrong with the story, the entire movie could be completely purposeless. The problem I had with this movie was that I couldn't really find a message. I herd everywhere that Joker was amazing because of how it portrayed our society and how it showed us the cold truth that we live in, but actually, is you look up on the internet (which I did), you'll see that there are a million of different interpretations of the movie, some of which either contradict each other or simply don't make absolute sense. The grand issue of Joker, that it tried to portray itself as a very smart movie packed with meaning, but as it turns out, it's just a movie about a mentally ill that starts committing murders because of ""self defense"". The entire speech he gives at the Murray Franklin show comes out of nowhere trying to justify his actions, but there is no background to it, he is just hurt by the idea that no one finds him funny. As the title of this review says, this is a great movie by accident, so, what exactly is that accident? That accident is called post-truth, the philosophical concept that states reality is objective, and facts don't matter, only feelings, meaning that everyone just sees what they want in every situation, and that is a modern problem that nowadays the society suffers from, and that is perfectly seen in how people reacted to the movie, seeing whatever each one wanted to see, depending on what are their interests and what are the things that matter to them. That, exactly that right there, is why I think joker is a great movie, because of the effect it caused to society, because of how everyone turned mad after seeing it and started seeing what they wanted and what they needed to see. Joker, or more specifically, Joker's effect on society, really portrays a severe problem of society: how fact don't matter anymore and how the objective truth is gone; how everyone sees what they want in every situation; how each and every one of us stopped caring about what's actually happening and started ""believing"" in themselves and in their way of seeing life; and how we don't even realize about it. Today society's problem is simply a problem of beliefs, a problem of post-truth.",Mark S,3.5

09-Mar-20,Brilliant. Something that needs to be watched multiple times.,Phil W,5
08-Mar-20,"It does not have an atmosphere as such. The farther you look, the more it is lost and eventually disappears. Apparently, there was an attempt to achieve the desired effect, it did not work out. A very unsuccessful attempt to make tension. This is manifested in almost all intense scenes. Especially the scene where Arthur got wet in the rain and came to his neighbor. There is generally nonsense, absolutely. Ie naive not real tension. Not only is Arthur Fleck a typical cliched psychopath, he is also poorly shown in terms of his actions. A Joker's fantasies destroyed at least some atmosphere of the film. To confuse the audience, this is something that must be done carefully so that there is such a raisin. And this is one of the minuses of the film.",,1.5
08-Mar-20,"I don't like many DC movies because it doesn't really speak out to me. But i have heard many great things about this movie that i have decided to watch it, good thing that i did. The tone of this movie is very dark and yet it never feels like you are getting bored through the entire movie. I can't judge if they have done the origin story right of Joker because I don't watch or read DC related things. But from a guy that watches movie and isn't really a fan of DC, I gotta say that this movie really surprised me and is definitely fresh in my opinion.",Mj P,5
08-Mar-20,"Besides Joaquin Phoenix's great performance I found this film depressing, badly written, and very overrated.",Tony B,1.5
08-Mar-20,"It wasn't bad. A good portrayal of a man with mental illness, a history of abuse and bullying going into the downward spiral to insanity. It dragged on at points but a good story and plot overall. Didn't add up to the hype for me. Zazie Beetz acting (or lack there of) really bogged down Joaquin's performance since even in the few seconds she was on screen he was having to carry her. It's worth watching at least once.",Johnathan D,3.5
08-Mar-20,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen. I haven't been this affected by a movie in quite a long time. I couldn't get it out of my head for several days afterwards. This is the best performance I've ever seen Joaquin Phoenix give as well. He is the perfect Joker. My favorite portrayal of the Joker ever put to film. This movie made me feel extremely uncomfortable and made me think about how is as a society treat people with mental illness. It made me have sympathy for Arthur and understand what he was going through without making me agree with what he did. This was such a real, raw look at the mental issues someone can have, and if not given help and being treated like shit everyday of their life, they can snap. I knew that he was going to snap, but I found myself not wanting him to. This movie made me feel exactly how it was supposed to, and I think we could use more movies like this in today's society. One's that make you feel uncomfortable and make you question what you believe. This movie is art. The cinematography and score is stunning as well. Joaquin definitely deserved that Oscar he got!",Bailey M,5

05-Mar-20,"Terrible Movie! They could have done an awesome job if they would have had more of a storyline. If people think this is a masterpiece, they need to go back and watch the other Batman moves/series with their rendition of Joker. Anyone else's version of Joker is better than this one, including the version of Joker they portray in the series Gotham! They sold tickets for this in theatres, and later on rentals of this movie based on the name alone, thinking it was enough. Terrible! The Joke is on you if you got conned into seeing this, as I was, I guess I can find humor in that. They had a great character to work with and they did not do him justice. I never expected it to be comparable to Heath Ledger's Joker but this film did not even come close. Try harder next time Hollywood!",Jill S,0.5

04-Mar-20,"Soundtrack, photo, and of course the act of Joaquin! Oh my, the construction of the Joker during the movie it Is something that whenever the movie ends, you will clap your hands. It is a must watch. In an era of Super hero movies with cliche scripts, this one brings a class act.",Eduardo H,5
04-Mar-20,"Joker offers an incredibly interesting take on the super-hero movie by taking a character from Batman and putting them in an incredibly real world. That is this movie's biggest strength. This movie really makes you think about our own world, and, in an industry full of CGI action movies, it is an important film. Obviously, Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is the stand out of the movie. He is able to make the character saddening and threatening at the same time. And while it isn't anything new, I really liked how they handled the bridge between reality and things inside of his head. Another strength is the use of visuals. I really enjoyed a lot of the shots in this movie and felt that it actually added to the tone of the movie. However, this movie does have it's problems. For example, I feel that a lot of the violence did feel unnecessary. The movie could easily be PG-13, yet it feels like the studio wanted this movie to be an R. Which is fine, I just feel that a PG-13 rating would have opened it up to a wider audience and would have diminished some of the unnecessary violence in the movie. While a lot of the press is saying that this movie will cause violence, I don't think it will. I think that the point of this movie is to emphasize that we should take time to think about how we treat people with disabilities in our culture. Another thing that somewhat annoyed me was the way a lot of Batman references were forced into the film. I feel that the movie could have easily done fine if they ditched the odd sub-plot between Arthur and Thomas Wayne. But again, this is an overall wonderful movie that I feel is getting a lot of unnecessary bad press.",Logan G,4

03-Mar-20,"It helps to know the Joker if you're a fan of the comic books. I'm a big Batman fan. When I saw they were doing an origin story with his background I figured, ""There's no backstory, he's just evil that came out of nowhere, leave it at that."" One part of it, I'm right and another part it does give a plausible explanation. The results were good. But I don't think it's worth bragging about. Excellent photography. Excellent performance of the Joker. But I think where it falls short is the reasoning behind it, and how it ties up with Bruce Wayne's father. His backstory seems 'same old, same old' vibe. His reasoning would probably make it tie up with DC's character. But all in all, it was worthwhile. It was humorous in parts, and deadly in others. Do I consider it perfect? Not really. Was it a poor execution of it? Not in the slightest.",Seth M,3.5

03-Mar-20,"This is a horror film. That could be my entire review, but of course there is more to it than that. This movie is a condemnation of a society failing to take care of its people, especially those who need it most. In the beginning of the film Arthur is a struggling young man with a poor paying job, barely holding things together as he is supporting his elderly mother. He suffers from the effects of a brain injury received in his youth, but with his medication and help from meetings with his public social worker he is getting by. When he loses his job, can no longer afford his prescriptions, and loses his case worker due to budget cuts in the city, his world begins to fall apart, as does his ability to interact appropriately with other humans. This film is fantastic on essentially all accounts and hearkens to the gritty, unsettling mood and empathy for a loathesome lead character akin to another fantastic film ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer."" If you liked Joker please do yourself a favor and check out that film, but during daylight hours on a sunny day. It is because of this bleak outlook and overall quality that it is almost hard to believe this is a DC universe film and not a standalone independent film. However, there is enough connection to the familiar Batman story material to clearly link this to others in that universe, in story, if not tone.",Anton Toombes,5

02-Mar-20,"Joker is a movie we don't get to see as often anymore. It cannot be argued that it is an award winning film. The movie itself shows the world how it truly is and all the harsh reality that happens around us when all we do is walk away and ignore it until we're the ones in the situation. Joker has won many awards and very well deserved especially for its amazing actresses. I believe the director of this film wanted us to know the Joker/Authors story and he gave us more than that. We learned about this story, what drove him to be the way he is and what all the hero stuff really meant. Seeing that the way he was treated and how it's something that happens all over. Joker is quite a film. I believe it speaks for itself and it has many things to say. It brought out so many things out of the audience including me and I as well as many other people can back up how incredibly realistic that film was. Everything the author did was done on purpose and our job as an audience is to figure out that purpose. In my point of view it's something that creates emphasis. The Director of the film as well as any author has the decision whether to repeat something or add something new. How I see it, the director repeated himself to emphasize on that certain point. It lets the audience see just how important it is. It is something done with purpose! There are many reasons why a movie would keep repeating itself and I also believe that a movie can have more than one plot. This movie in particular is one of them. I would really recommend this film for the great actresses as well as the content it carries. The movie itself is exciting and intriguing.",Jaquelin B,5

01-Mar-20,"I saw the (mostly negative) reviews in the big newspapers (NYT, WP, etc) and websites long ago when the movie came out, but I just rewatched it and just wanted to share my two cents. Joker has been wildly criticized. A common reason of criticism was the claim that association between mental illness and violence sends the wrong message about both. Personally, I think we tend to overlook subtleties and jump to conclusions that are hard-and-fast, black and white. There's a difference between understanding the reasons behind a behavior and justifying it. Joker does a wonderful job at the former: we get the bigger picture, we see where he is coming from, and have light on the whys behind his actions. Yes, Joker does embody the dangerous result of a sick mind and an alienating society, as he says it so well just before killing Murray. His actions, atrocious as they are, do not invalidate this fact. Another point refers to the generalization of violent behavior. Obviously, not everyone who is mentally ill is a potential murderer, but everyone who is mentally ill in a society that does not offer support is extra vulnerable to becoming violent, if the wrong combinations are at play. What is art if not a portrait of real life? So the movie does a great job bringing the issue up. Again, it is not about justifying Joker's actions. It's about understanding and empathizing with the history, but not the action. It's about understanding and about NOT condoning the behavior. I got out of it with so many insights, but I believe these can be lost in the fleeting moment critics fall prey to their own knee-jerk reactions to violence and biases. Joker's actions are understandable given his circumstances, but that doesn't mean they are justified and I think that's the point the movie tried to make. I appreciated the acting, the soundtrack and the overall development of the character, ever so slowly but surely, into the maniac. Phoenix definitely deserved the Oscar.",Johnson M,5

29-Feb-20,"Oh god, the Joker. What a masterclass in filmmaking, mood, acting, the dance of the camera, the play of colours and textures and gripping music. Todd Phillips has created something so powerful, so compelling that you can't help at marvel at it as a piece of cinema. Of course this is Joaquin Phoenix's moment of glory, like all his previous acting roles weren't already right up there with the best on screen performances, here he takes it up another notch, maybe to the top notch. The pain and trouble behind his eyes can only be awed at. I found myself not wanting this film to end, I love the way we intimately see his journey and every incident and knock back, every heart wrenching glimpse of sadness of this tormented soul stoking the fire of not only his demise but also his rise. He made us feel a release through the imagery of killing his own mother, he allowed us in to his hopelessly lost mind where a different kind of sense actually made sense. Phoenix had me glued to the screen, I didn't even want to miss any it to go to the toilet. There was so much to love about the production design, the bleakness of it, the hardness of it and the use of lighting to give a grade to the film as opposed to it being graded and colour washed heavily after the fact. Really nice use of CGI to augment the city scenes and make it dank and dystopian. The quant mix of old and new technology to create a parallel but alternate universe. None of this seemed out of place, it all went into creating a seamless whole and the viewer was totally sucked into this world and bought into it without question despite the quirkiness and asynchronous nature, no doubt adding to the overall feel of uneasiness and tension. I think you either get this film or you don't. The message here was clearly one of mental health and not only the health of an individual but the health of a nation as a result of the attitude to the central theme. The slow boiling of the main character with no let up or relapse, just a continual build of tension throughout the piece, leaving you unsure of what could happen next and who was at risk around Fleck as he proceeded to his climatic scene where he finally found his audience, the one he'd been craving his whole life. The crushing sense of defeat too as he went about his daily life added even more and piled on the immense sense of dread and sadness felt by Fleck. The maintenance and the slow build of this film is where the masterful direction of Phillips is so apparent. Forget the politics, this was a huge billboard of a message, shining the light and showing the plight of those who suffer from mental illness no matter how big or small. The cinematography, man, I couldn't tell you much about it other than it was flawless and unnoticeable - in the best way. There were some lovely scenes that really took your breath but most of the time it just supported the story and that's the most you can ask of your photographer - to assist and add to the story telling and not to detract from it. The sense of darkness and dread I felt were perfectly married with the lighting and mood of the piece. For a tale that was originally a comic book storyline featuring gaudy characters who never really had much character, this shows you what can be achieved in the right hands from such an almost insignificant starting point of reference. Sure, Heath Ledger did a brilliantly good job in the Nolan reboot, but for me, Phoenix wiped the floor with Ledgers performance and elevated it to the stratosphere in The Joker. It takes a special team of people to pull off such a great film and I can't wait to see what these guys get up to next. I hate sequels but I'd love to see more of this story.",Kenny E,5
29-Feb-20,"The Joker movie is a 2019 year psychological thriller. The film is an origin story for Batman's greatest nemesis, starring Joaquin Phoenix as a man called Arthur Fleck, who struggles with the weight of his mental illness and a miserable existence. Inside the misunderstood man lives a sadistic and psychopathic murderer. Eventually, he have been pushed too far, and he transforms himself into the Joker who begins to take revenge on the world. Phoenix is really into his character's insanity and it causes the viewer to be anxious in many different ways, because Arthur is often such a scary person. At the same time it is strangely funny that viewer also understands and even feels sorry for him for some reason. Arthur has been mistreated by the world all of his life and as a viewer might be startled when totally realizes why he becomes the Clown Prince of Gotham. A fantastic addition to this movie is the illness that Arthur's have, which makes him laugh recklessly, even though he doesn't want to. Phoenix may instantly start to howl when he laughs and also all the smile might suddenly just disappear off his face. He is scary but at the same time really sympathetic. The farther the movie goes, the bigger Phoenix gets to tear up and enjoy his role. The movie is a realistic story about a man who is plunged into deep darkness, mental illness and for everything what these kinds of problems might cause. Although the Joker is often perceived as a smiling and hilarious character, he can not really be called hilarious in his own movie. This is a truly distressing and heartbreaking piece with a slight sense of humor. The movie mercilessly takes its viewer inside Arthur's mind, which is plagued by many things. The character's journey from a boy who takes care of his mother to an iconic criminal is an extremely captivating in all its horror. The film is oddly fascinating and Arthur's sudden dances might go into hypnotism even though they are very confusing and weird. This is one of the best cartoon animations of all time perhaps because it never feels like it and overall, it is an incredibly great movie.",Annika L,5

It's a brutal sad movie probably not for everyone. Overall one of my favorite comic book movies of all time.

27-Feb-20,"A literature writing, the cinematography is created to criticize and lead humans toward awareness, education, and aesthetics. The Joker film version 2019 through the performance of actor JoaQuin Phoenix's success when covering all of these. Joker is not only a movie, but it is also a movie with many lessons within which teaches people who carefully pay attention to it in the cinema. When we are entertaining, it is not meant to be fun, but to satisfy our soul, and to empathy and understand the character through many stages of emotion. If everyone is finding entertaining in a joyful way, the won't be able to empathize with the pain of the society, the suffering from the human race and the exploitation behind the luxurious of human society. Joker used to be a clown who entertained people with his humorous but when he takes his mask off, he turned back to a man who is suffering from his disability and man-made exploitation. Joker's success is to counter evil, educate, and reclaim the justice of humans. Joker said: ""We stop searching for ghosts under our bed when we realized it inside."" The Joker has manifested the whole of evil, and the injustice created by humanity and society with the advice of reflecting on yourself.",Marcus N,5

27-Feb-20,"Great acting, great plot, great visual storytelling & camerawork, great editing, great music, great character study, interesting ideas (such as the Joker's laugh being a medical condition as opposed to just some crazy laugh). The idea that the movie glorifies violence is ridiculous. If you were going to somehow stretch it to that, you'd be better off saying that treating people like garbage is how you get violence in society. I don't think that's the message either, the message to me is how ""one bad day"" can make anybody go off the deep end, even some guy who likes to make children laugh by dressing as a clown & takes care of his mother at home. Personally, I disagree that this Joker is on Ledger's level, only because I think Ledger's joker more accurately depicts the character as an agent of chaos as opposed to an agent of class warfare like this one is. I know they try to sprinkle in the chaos aspect to his character, but at its core that is not who this guy is. He didn't look at society and take initiative to change it, society forced him to confront it. Anyway, I'm moving away from the point, the point is, this is a great movie. Go watch it if you haven't.",Anthony C,4.5

So I decided to watch the movie. Honestly, I didn't think it would be amazing, I thought it would be OK (because of DC's past reputation). But I was very wrong. I actually loved it. It had some flaws, of course, as all movies do, but this was a movie I would definitely watch again. They took a new turn to your iconic Joker and that was not a bad idea. Joaquin Phoenix portrayed the laugh, the madness, the insanity and the feelings flawlessly. The only problem I had with this movie is that it over-romanticises the concept that Arthur is a clown-for-hire. They could of easily made this movie at least 1hr 30mins long because of all the unnecessary scenes of Arthur as a funny clown rather than a murderous clown. Great movie! Watch it if you haven't.",Ozgun K,4.5

24-Feb-20,"I've known people who talk and present themselves like Arthur Fleck.. and find them unbearable. I can't pretend that wasn't the point of the character, but it makes his ""hero"" status at the end of the movie -given to him by the protesting citizens of Gotham, as for some audience members who watched this movie- hard to buy. The following comparison is over the top; but it's like the infamous Youtuber Chris-Chan becoming a cult leader, because he pushed Harvey Weinstein under a passing bus one day and then laughed about it on live television. It's still Chris-Chan here, not a character you'd call ""cool"", ""slick"", or anything similar to that. And that was kinda what I was hoping Arthur would be, at least in his own mind. But even in his imagination he was awkwardly lame, and it can be argued that the entirety of the movie was his imagination. I mean, the role was well acted by Phoenix, can't slam that, but every time Arthur did or said something that was even a little bit badass, something would take it away. For example, Arthur kills a guy and then does the jungle boogie on a set of stairs, but the moment the police finds him, he bolts it a frightened toddler. The shift of tone would've been funny in a comedy, but doesn't work here. His scene with Murray at the end was powerful and exciting stuff, but the sentence ""They think that we'll just sit there and take it, like good little boys! That we won't werewolf and go wild!"" is so uncool, like holy snap. And how he switched over to calling Murray awful was too sudden as well, like there used to be a bit that came before it they cut. I wanted to like this movie more, but the awkwardness sprinkled throughout it didn't hype me up for the character that is Arthur Fleck. But, despite my complaints, I think that's fine. None of the characters in the movie itself are on Fleck's side. He's a bother to them, while he's obviously trying, and a socially inept mess who thinks he has a future as a worshipped idol. I think there's room for him to develop into something less inconsistent in the sequel, which may or may not come.",Dee R,3.5

24-Feb-20,"Phoenix did a phenomenal job considering I did not think anyone would be able to play Joker after the death of the greatest Joker of all time. Heath now has at least an equal. While they are clearly different portrayals, Phoenix's could easily become what Ledger's was although I don't think the reverse is true. I will commit heresy and say it. I like this Joker better than Ledger's. Why? Well...the insanity is developed although he's clearly insane from the beginning, it gets better and better or worse and worse...depending on your perspective. Phoenix's Joker's laugh may be criticized by some and honestly I can understand their initial dislike...but if you stop and think about why he might be laughing at the beginning of the movie and why at the end and the subtle differences in them, I think anyone can come to the conclusion, if they'll be honest and objective, this was an amazing version done by an amazing actor, who is clearly a psychopath himself to be able to do this. Love him or hate him. He's a great actor and this may be close to his best if not the best role he's ever had...except for maybe when he plays himself. That is truly a masterpiece. The movie itself was not what I expected...I don't really think I expected anything in particular except that it would not be your typical comic book origin and that holds true. But at the same time, it could be...especially the ending. It's magically insane and absolutely perfectly what a Joker who has really lost all scope of reality and has intentionally, due to circumstances he did not like about his life I won't spoil for you, killed any moral compass which was inside of him if it was there at all to begin with...which is questionable. I think one of the coolest things about this portrayal was that just as a standalone movie without knowledge of any of what's to come with Batman, it was basica�lly as good as knowing what was coming in the future as irrrelevant as Batman showing up to fight him should be seen. Sure the joker needed someone who go to toe with him without being unhcecked, but honestly that is just because we like our heroes. This joker is literally perfect for either way of seeing this film and I'm very glad to hear his fake laugh...so he won't cry aslike hearing the laugh that says I""m laughing because what you think is important is nothing to me. I will watch this place go do down and absolutely for no other reason than it seems to mirror his own self observations about how he went up in flames and enjoyed it happening to him too. He is the joker I've always wanted to see. Maybe a little human at the beginning and even fearlessly vulnerable only to be squashed and laugh about it. It's perfect and well deserved Oscar performance.",Matthew T,5

I have always been a huge fan of comic books and comic book movies, and just the thought of having one focused on my favorite comic book character, the Clown Prince Of Crime himself was such a delight for me, and let me just say that this film does not disappoint! This film gave me chills with its more humanizing, and serious take on the Joker as a person first and as his alter ego more gradually and chillingly over the course of the film. Joaquin Pheonix gives an exceptional performance as Arthur Fleck, and ultimately left me speechless and on edge throughout the course of the film. In fact the entire cast all give exceptional performances which makes the overall tone that much more tense when they need to be in a truly powerful way.

Thankfully this movie like Spider-Man 2, Logan, Batman: The Dark Knight, and X-Men Days of Future Past before, reminds us that there can be superhero movies with depth, but Hollywood is just lazy.

22-Feb-20,"(SPOILER FREE REVIEW) Joker is one of those movies where they try to make the bad guy look like a hero... which it isn't, this movie is a fucking acid trip and you cant tell whats real or not on your first watch, the more you watch and the more you understand what the hell is going on with it. Joker is a fantastic movie and is 100% one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time, Joaquin Phoenix shows why he deserved the Oscar and it shows. the soundtrack in the movie gives that 1980s feeling while making it dark with its tone. in conclusion joker is a 100% good movie",Lucas H,5

22-Feb-20,"When you read comments online you think how this would be masterpiece, and it is far away from that. It is just ridiculous how so many people compare this with Heath Ledger's role of Joker in Dark Knight, and this is not near that. This movie is just like one of those bad sequel or bad copy of original movie. Mass of people love this because there is anarchy and total destruction, it is that mind set, because politicians are bad, we should burn other people cars, houses, and randomly kill and rob people in the name of better tomorrow. And this movie summarize perfectly state of society on global scale. They blame everybody else for their own failure, just not themselves (look at the mirror). Yea things isn't perfect, never was, never will be, but exactly because of that we should change things to be better, not worse. Going around the world angry, crazy, with hatred in our hearts wont change anything. This movie is below average, but you can sell it if mob identified with main character and his vision of ""perfect"" lawlessness. Sad times, we blur the lines between good and evil.",Jaguar P,0.5

21-Feb-20,"Joaquin portrayed this Joker perfectly. Every little facial expressions were to point and you could slowly see the character develop from various angles like his laughter. At the beginning of the movie we see Joker crying and choking over his uncontrollable laughter and it really brought an uncomfortable feeling, letting us fully relate with the character. However, Joker later grows to accept his laughter, embracing his 'Joker self' as his says 'There nothing left to lose'. I don't get how people are saying that Joker might cause and inspire mass murders and riots because Arthur is not a normal person, he is a mentally ill person that struggles to live. He never killed the three man in the subway to start a political movement and to inspire a riot. He did it simply because they were awful to him. Same as Murray.

19-Feb-20,"DC abandons their Extended Cinematic Universe and attempts to revive the Batman franchise with the indie character drama Joker. The story follows a psychologically disturbed clown named Arthur Fleck who's an aspiring comic as he's fired from his job and gets a shot on a late night talk show after the host riffs on a video of one of Fleck's stand-up routes. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, and Brett Cullen, the film has a pretty decent cast that gives good performances; though Phoenix often overacts, drawing attention to how weird and eccentric he's being for no reason. And the liberal politics are not in any way subtle, overshadowing the plot at time. Still, it does do some interesting things with the Batman mythos and there are some exciting and fun action scenes. Yet while Joker is a novel addition to the Batman franchise, the film style doesn't really feel apiece with the material.",Dann M,3
19-Feb-20,"Joaquin Phoenix soooooooo deserved the Oscar he received for this role. I have always loved him anyway, ever since Parenthood. He is such a Great actor! And fascinating to watch.

19-Feb-20,"This is going to be one of those posts where I go against the mainstream but my reaction when I watched this movie was: You got to be f� kidding me? The only resemblance to the REAL joker in this movie is the name. As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker. The ""Joker"" in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting. The REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase. The movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it's qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed. However, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that's Hollywood today. That the politically biased and elitist so called ""critics"" on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites. Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy ""review"" site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.",Per G,1

In a time of school shootings and Trump stirring anger in the overlooked working class, the theme is even more important. The film came across as a cautionary tale or urban legend to warn audiences of a nation breeding such sadistic personalities. I do not buy this movie copying Scorsese but pointing to characters Scorsese has created with De Niro, a vigilante Bickle and an obsessive comedian wanting fame. It points out the persistence of dealing with such angry, white male characters.",Scott F,5

19-Feb-20,"The film does not offer much in terms of backstory, other than snippets I suspect audiences could have presumed already. ""The Dark Knight"" features a Joker who is a menacing and complex villain, an embodiment of pure anarchy, and this film's origin story just does not live up to Nolan's superb depiction. Heath Ledger's Joker was cunning, witty and sardonic. Fleck is none of those things. Scene after scene hammers home the same point: he is just a really weird guy with some bad luck. The film's violence is wince-worthy, successfully disturbing and unnerving, while Hildur Gu�nad�ttir's dramatic and haunting score adds to the effect, but what the film lacks is an in-depth exploration of Fleck's motives. During his appearance on Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), Fleck unleashes an angry and cathartic monologue, but the writing is too vague to make a coherent point. ""Joker"" is miles away from zippy Marvel films, but it still lacks thought-provoking themes, a unique point of view and an overall interesting backstory for such a worthy villain. ""Joker"" is just the latest example of vapid and hollow comic-book storytelling brought to the big screen.",Adam B,2.5

18-Feb-20,"Finally got to see this movie and found myself transported to his sad, dark world. It's was such a sad movie bc I felt his ""pain"" and it hit upon so many things I've seen and/or have heard about when it come to mental illness. I don't condone murder and such violence upon anyone but you cannot blame the ""victim"" or person suffering from such illness. You should NEVER ever kick anybody when they're down, of course never kick nor fuck with anyone in the first place because you never know what you might get. I consider Joaquin such an amazing actor and he indeed nailed this part as he has in all his movies!!! Have such love for him since Gladiator, I hated him as Commodus as he's so convincing an actor. He was so good in that film. Walked the Line, he totally transformed himself into the man in Black, he nailed that performance so much I remember being blown away! Now Joker, I loved him so much in this, from the makeup, clothing, color scheme and mood, musical score, etc and I wasn't shocked by the ""acts of violence"" because in the storyline, with how he was treated and all he seemed to want was love, the truth and to better himself, THEY DESERVED what they got.

There is no true protagonist in the film so we found ourselves wondering what the film was really about and why we were sitting there. Some soft alluded commentary about mental health but it was hard to be sympathetic to anyone in this film so that point is somewhat lost. Turns out this film, despite the title, isn't even about the actual Joker from Batman. I learned this factoid after the movie not from the movie.",Ken I,2.5

18-Feb-20,"I really don't understand the controversy surrounding this movie at all. He kills 6 people in total and 3 are in self defense. It's a very dark look at the reality of people who fall through the cracks of a broken system that can't get help. It shows how few people really care about helping the impoverished even when they claim they're helping are only doing so to feel morally superior to those around them. In one scene Joker is talking a political candidate who claims he's going to help the people of Gotham who were at the lower levels of the system. The candidate gets angry with Joker because of Joker's medical condition and punches him in the face, leaving Joker bleeding in the bathroom and continues watching a matinee with his family. Joker throughout the movie is betrayed by everyone he cares about and forced into terrible situations without any good solutions and then shamed for making any decision that is left to him. I think that the reason people don't like this movie isn't because of the violence (there isn't much as I pointed out earlier) but rather they don't like looking at outcasts from society and ""creepy"" people as anything more than subhuman and are scared of the fact that someday those people who society has stepped on might actually fight back.",Andrew B,5

17-Feb-20,"The Joker, followed the life of our protagonist Arthur, a lower class sign spinning clown with a history of mental illness. When first introduced to Arthur we see a depressed individual who struggles to succeed in his dream to be a comedian, as the oppressive society he was raised in and the upper elites who control it have hindered the lives of people with mental health illnesses. The lighting throughout the tended to follow Arthurs emotional state, as depressed nights alone at home for Arthur were presented in darker eerie lighting, while generally happier scenes like when Arthur dreams on being on the Murray Show are displayed with bright lights and seemingly genuine smiles. We are thrown into the subjective mind of Arthur at times due to the directing style, keeping the audience guessing what is real and what is not. For instance, the scene of Arthur meeting the woman in the elevator and the several dates they went on exemplify this point. We see this happy life that Arthur chases earlier in the film, and after meeting girl who adores him for his originality and uniqueness, it seems like Arthurs luck might be turning around. But you can't forget the overall purpose and social commentary of this film, which is for mental health awareness, when analyzing the directing style. The goal was for the audience to empathize with Arthur by putting us in his shoes and literally only seeing what Arthur sees, despite his loose grip on reality to begin with. I enjoyed the film and thought it was an overall well done movie. It was able to get its point across to the audience without being pushy or overt. While there is some ties to past films like the Dark Knight trilogy and other aspects of that universe, the film could stand independently of this connection and seems more connected to the overall message itself. The mentally ill get no support in this society, as city funded therapy sessions are cut and the only real effort to assistance for the mentally ill seems to be throwing them into a run down asylum. This effort seemed to be spearheaded by Thomas Wayne and the elites of Gotham who appear to want to hide away the mentally ill like a blemish to the city rather than treating them as people and giving them help. Without real help available, this entire clown movement started as the lower and working classes rallied behind the Joker who remained an anonymous clown on the subway who killed some younger white collar business kids that beat and demoralized him. In order for the leaders or superiors to gain respect and support from their citizens or followers, there needs to be mutual benefit for both sides. And with continuous suppression and the ostracizing nature of Gotham, the suffering citizens came together to make their own difference to the city via violent uprising.",Morgan R,4.5

17-Feb-20,"Down to Clown?- Joker Review- Joker is a 2019 film directed by Todd Phillips that follows Arthur Fleck in the origin story of the infamous villain of Gotham. The film, set in the 1980s, depicts both Arthur's internal and external conflicts that lead to him becoming ""Joker"". As much as this film is a Joker origin story, it is also a Batman origin story. This film is an interesting example of the Good vs. Evil archetype. Unlike other films from this archetype, Arthur is both the protagonist and the antagonist. His own inner turmoil leads to his own defeat, or rather, victory as he becomes the Joker. There are multiple social commentaries woven into this film, one being how society treats the mentally ill. This film focuses on the many struggles that the mentally ill face, such as a lack of support and monetary barriers to receiving medication and access to mental health professionals. Additionally, it also highlights the difficulties associated with trying to reincorporate oneself into society. Arthur frequently refers to how society expects the mentally ill to behave as if they are not. Another prominent social commentary is socioeconomic disparities. There are many clown protests against the rich and powerful. There are also newspaper headlines reading ""Kill the Rich"". I thought this inclusion in the film was interesting as this is a prominent social debate in modern society. Especially as the 2020 election draws near, wealth disparity and taxing the rich is an interesting debate. One thread throughout this film is the gesture of putting a ""finger gun"" to the head and pulling the trigger. This gesture alludes to the film Taxi Driver. It may also allude to the late Heath Ledger and his suicide after playing the Joker. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. I enjoy the commentary about mental health and economic disparities, however, I think the plot and storyline are a bit confusing at times. The resolution of this film depicts Arthur in a mental hospital telling a story and leaves viewers questioning if any of the events in the film actually happened.",Lindsey L,4

17-Feb-20,"Phillips hijacks the DC Comics mythos to ride it to more profound and realistic territories it was never designed to explore. At best, Joker is a constantly wink-wink-nudge-nudging homage to the golden age of Scorsese films from movie geeks for movie geeks, fueled by a dark energy that never lets down. At worst, an unashamed patchwork of entire sequences from everything like Taxi Driver through The King of Comedy to Tim Burton's Batman.",Andras G,3.5

16-Feb-20,"Director: Todd Phillips Writers: Todd Phillips, Scott Silver Stars: Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy This film for me is fantastic. Everything from the acting, to the directing, to the cinematography, sound and editing. In Gotham City, mentally troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: the Joker. This film has a great sense of suspense, tension and dread. It really depicts how mental illness and society can tear people apart. The use of dark colors (Black, Brown, etc) really gives off the impression how gruesome and dirty Gotham can be. The use of music in this film really heightens the tension, the score really sells the transformation of the Joker. It is bone-chilling and gut-wrenching. Our leader through this world is the relentless Joaquin Phoenix, who gives what is very possibly the finest performance of his career. He summons the feeling that he was born to play this role. The writers (Todd Phillips and Scott Silver) placed all their cards in the Joker character with the film relying on him in every scene, and phoenix delivers to an incredibly high standard. Joaquin Phoenix is truly Oscar Worthy in this film. I personally believe that this film will be a classic in years to come. Even though the events that are depicted have shown controversy, I think it will gain a cult following. 92nd Academy Awards Films I have seen to date: 1917 10/10 Little Women 10/10 Parasite 10/10 Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood 9.5/10 Jojo Rabbit 9.5/10 The Irishman 9/10 Marriage Story 9/10 Joker 9/10 Bombshell 8.5/10 A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood 8.5/10 Ford v Ferrari 8/10 The Two Popes 8/10 Toy Story 4: in 3D -7.5/10 How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World: in 3D 7/10",Robbie D,5

He had a very loudly laugh but he had weak and hurting in himself this was remarkable it makes you fell the pain that he is feeling and he had a great transformation from the the normal physiological patient to high level of physiological problems that make him the joker and made him kill three people, kill his mother and robert de niro character and the movie had a great cinematography and directing, too and the movie had very good plot twists that blowing your mind like that the joker is a half brother to bruce wayne the movie took this plot twist and made a plot twist from a plot twist that the joker's mother is a physiological patient, too and she was lieing about the half brother then we have the great plot twist that all of the movie is just from the imagination of Arthur flick but the movie had a lot of things from Martin scorsese's movies like taxi driver and the king of comedy and that was the biggest issue in the movie.

16-Feb-20,"The Joker - Good vs. Evil The archetype of this movie is based on perspective. The good vs. evil typology is based on what perspective the audience sides with, and based on the perspective, determines who is good and who is evil. I want to lay out several perspectives as I have seen in the movie. First, the perspective as told from the main character the Joker. Obviously, Arthur has severe metal illnesses that he is keenly aware of, which seem to be the root of his problems. Not only his mental illness, but also the absence of a father figure leads Arthur to take the victim stance. Some of the things that happen to Arthur are bad no matter the perspective. The movie leads with him getting jumped by a group of kids while he is working. No matter the perspective we can see that Arthur is the good, and the kids are the bad. However, the mirrored situation on the train when the guys try to jump him, he pulls out a gun and kills all three. This decay into mental illness construes the situations and makes Arthur into a good guy doing what he sees as justified. The other perspective is one that does not conflate the feelings of Arthurs interpersonal life and does not allow the sound and the lighting (all important aspects of the feeling of the movie) to obscure the logical reasoning of good vs. evil. I think we can all agree that bringing a gun into a children's hospital and getting fired for it is justified. Killing a man on live T.V. because of humiliation and mental illness is not justified. Killing three men on a subway for slapping you around and stealing your hat is not justified. Stalking the child (Batman) of your absconded father and grabbing him by the face is not justified. These points show how Arthur is decaying into severe mental illness and not matter the context put him into the position of evil. The movie tries to give humanity to what The Joker does, and in my judgment, the movie does a really good job of this. The world has wronged him and he exacts revenge.",Logan B,4.5

If something in this movie makes you uncomfortable that's probably a good thing haha I have some gripes with the writing that would knock off a star actually but Joaquin Phoenix performance in my opinion makes it 5 stars. movie without him and with a bad (cookie cutter basic) director would be a 3. but with the direction and phoenix it makes it a 4.5 for me and that rounds up to 5,Trey N,5
16-Feb-20,"Amazing commentary and movie, with all scenes being absolutely amazing. Such a great film.",John D,5
16-Feb-20,Phoenix makes a Good Joker. I say Good because the Film in itself could of been better. The Story and Plot could of done more to pull you in with interest. All and all good and entertaining,Benjamin C,2.5
16-Feb-20,"I was super excited about this film so I was disappointed to find that the themes, world building were half baked. I was so frustrated because there were so many brilliant ideas about the haves and the have nots. The trailer seemed to wink at things like Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. This was such an interesting thing to explore about the 1 percent as Batman is a billionaire. But they didn't really delve into the class divide and why they were rioting beyond mere sketch and plot device. It felt lazy. I feel like even the mental illness part could have been more nuanced. Even the Joker being constantly beat up to show his demise felt lazy. I would have like to see how he could have misconstrued what people said rather than him just simply always the victim of bullies etc. there were some interesting twists about his back story. I'm so frustrated that a film so fertile with ideas and with so much potential fell so flat for me and ended up weirdly safe, obvious and generic, even with the ""shock factor"".",Joahna D,2.5
16-Feb-20,"Spare me the talk that the treatment is irresponsible and it's empty at the core. You can tell a great, powerful story without unnecessary burden. This film takes a difficult topic (mental health) and an impossible character (Joker) and somehow blended something that makes sense. Then there's Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which alone is worth the entry price. Then there's the stairs scene.",Thiam P,5
16-Feb-20,"Acting may have been good. However, I was so turned off by the darkness and the violence. My husband picked it out based for some odd reason. I wish I would not have watched it. I felt it was horrible actually - I'd give it less than 1 - maybe a minus 3 if I had that option.",Diane G,0.5
16-Feb-20,Great movie. Really portrays a lot of psychological meaning with a comic movie twist at the ending.,,4
16-Feb-20,"Joaquin Phoenix did a great performance as the Joker,,,,the laughing...he nailed it... the clothing...the makeup on his face...truly an amazing movie...especially all those surrounding location and peoples which somehow takes you back to early 80s... and...and...the color grading is spectacular!...I love it!",Roland A,5

15-Feb-20,Oh God I want my 2 hours back. I was so bored the whole way through this film.,Rob P,2
15-Feb-20,A masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix treats us to the best performance ever brought to screen. The fact that this film is only a 68 by critics here is absolutely criminal. Everything about this piece of art is perfection.,Patricia B,5
15-Feb-20,"There is value in seeing this simply for Joaquin's performance. I'm not a fan of him as a person, but the transformation and embodiment of this character is impressive. There is a decently constructed tone and look to the film, but really lacks in any depth of thoughtfulness beyond the surface of this comic book world.",Chris A,3.5

15-Feb-20,"Wow. That was something special. I had low expectations, which might have helped, going in. Also, I do not ever watch superhero or action films--no Marvel Universe or any of the others--and this might have also helped shape my perceptions going in. Joker is a sad sad tale of mental illness and societal ills. It's a tragic and again v. sad--and I think very credible Joker origin story. Well-made, beautifully shot, skillfully acted. Shocked it only got 68% with critics and 88% with audience/normal people.",Susan D,4.5
15-Feb-20,"This movie was great. The acting was top notch. The cinematography was great, and the story really hit home with me. I'm not even a fan of the Joker character, yet I still enjoyed this movie. It deserves the praise its been getting from critics. Go see it.",Alex H,5

14-Feb-20,"I didn't have any expectations going into this movie. By the end I thought it was a masterpiece. The best story of the year. Arthur Fleck is a former mental hospital patient who now works as a professional sign holder. He dresses as a clown. One day he holds his sign and dances in front of a music store that is going out of business. He is assaulted and we see how broken he is. Arthur feels like human garbage because he cannot fight back. He has a social worker that tries to help him deal with his mental illness. To me, this conversation sums up Arthur's story. Arthur Fleck: I heard this song on the radio the other day, and the guy was singing that his name was Carnival. Social Worker: Arthur� Arthur Fleck: Which is crazy, because that's my clown name. At work, until a little while ago, it was like nobody ever saw me. Even I didn't know if I really existed. Social Worker: Arthur, I have some bad news for you. Arthur Fleck: You don't listen, do you? I don't think you ever really listened to me. You just ask the same questions every week. ""How's your job? Are you having any negative thoughts?"" All I have are negative thoughts. But you don't listen. Anyway, I said, for my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice. That's the very start of Arthur becoming Joker in this movie. It won two Oscars. One for Joaquin Phoenix as best actor portraying Arthur. The other for best musical score. If you aren't sure, just watch it anyhow. It's a masterpiece of story telling.",Birdissa W,5
14-Feb-20,Although the overall ton of Joker is depressing you leave the movie satisfied. Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is remarkable. I enjoyed getting a in depth look at what shaped the joker to become one of Gotham's most notorious villains.,Griffin R,4.5
14-Feb-20,Only reason this is not a 5 star is because it�s not a movie you need to see on the big screen. You�d get the exact same effect on your own tv.,,4.5
14-Feb-20,What makes this such an amazing and iconic is how divided it has made critics and viewers. Every person will walk away from this film with some sort of deep thoughts.

13-Feb-20,"Highly derivative of Martin Scorsese's work such as King of Comedy and Taxi Driver to the verge of it being a remake rather than being influenced by those movies. There were no great supporting characters as not enough development had went into them. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is a career-defining one but unfortunately due to the movies' puzzling message, his performance is not enough from saving the movie from being mediocre. Overall, this movie dives into mental illness and comes out with a puzzling resolution of what mental illness truly has on society because the movie only shows mental illness in a negative light and thus the movie handles the subject matter very poorly.",Araiz A,1
13-Feb-20,Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Fantastic! Cinematography. Great! Robert De Niro as Murray. Fantastic. Todd as the director. Beautiful! He did a awesome job. Hope you returns with this movie.,Ethan T,5
12-Feb-20,Worth a watch for the performance. Interesting take as an addition to all the other material on the Joker. Dark but watchable. The line is drawn as you never really feel sympathy enough to justify the Jokers actions but understand how he got there.

12-Feb-20,Joker was a very fun and interesting movie. Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as the joker and too me him and Heath Ledger are neck and neck. The story was awesome telling the origins of the joker and how he became what he did. I don't have have any issues with this movie and is one of my favorite movies. The cast is amazing and the director did an amazing job. 10/10,Elliot M,5
12-Feb-20,"The Joker is a film directed by Todd Philips, he's one of the best directors of the world. Its main actor is Joaquin Phoenix, who won a Grammy last Monday. The Joker, is a social critique about how to take care of people that ask for help. The plot is good, is about a person that has mental problems and everybody is very bad with him. The Joker never thought that his life would inspire that of others. It's a very strong movie that reflects as people with less resources are abused by people with more resources and this generates hate to on behalf of poor people towards rich people.",Juan David,5

12-Feb-20,"Whether you love DC or not, this is an Epic movie in itself. Especially the main character played by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker. Phoenix's immense acting and performance overall is the one to be admired and hailed for. It not only depicts some of the main problems of our modern society but also shows some of the most important reasons behind it. And all this with the backstory of Joker himself. This one will surely go down as one of the greatest cinema masterpiece.",Bishnu S,5
12-Feb-20,"Deep. Amazing. A few parts cliched as they have to be because you know some of the background to the joker already. But this movie will leave you breathless, legs shaking while you try to comprehend the extent of the madness that is the joker.",Fabian A,5
12-Feb-20,"Dark,Intense,Thriller, and was just straight up one of the greatest movies I had every seen Joaquin Phoenix with a phenomenal act and even won an oscar and golden globe award and well the music as well. a great DC movie probably one of the best ones but this joker was a more mental disorder and murder joker then we have seen in other batman movies but still maybe that will change in the future with there billion dollar hit at the box office I hope theres a sequel to joker everybody #joker2",,5

12-Feb-20,"Probably the most overrated movie I've seen in a long time. If this would have just been a movie about Arthur Fleck and not have any connection with Joker, I would have respected and liked this movie more. But as an origin story of the famous psycho clown, it fails as such.",rur D,2.5
12-Feb-20,"A very interesting study of a heavily warped mind. Many will find it boring - because there is a lot of scenes where nothing happens. However, these scenes very much set the tone of the whole movie and help flesh out what is happening at the mind of the titular character. I was very much entertained and surprised at how serious this movie was.",Marcin S,4.5

11-Feb-20,"I personally love this movie. However, these are objective opinion. Joaquin's acting was the best. However, in contrast, Todd Phillips's plot let me down... It was too succinct.

Definitely, the goal of this movie is clearing the mystery of Joker. But I don't agree with this expression...",,2.5

10-Feb-20,"Uncomfortable and thought-provoking. Never before have we been thrown into the world of an unstable and violent character in the way we do in Joker.

10-Feb-20,"Well this definitely was something, I'm not sure if enjoyable is the correct word but it definitely is worth watching, not for those who have any form of mental illness or watch a film only for fun though, as this is not that, this is not a film made for enjoyment alone, it doesn't seem so anyway. A true thought-provoking and challenging movie, it truly saddened me. finally giving depth to the once 2D arch-nemesis The Joker, never before has a film made me hate a character so much but at the same time making me feel utterly sad for them. And the acting from Joaquin Phoenix was exceptional, he is by far one of... if not the best actor in the whole of Hollywood. This is a masterpiece of modern cinema and I highly recommend",Egan M,5

10-Feb-20,It was in no way better than Heath Leadger's performance. No one now or then who has ever played the joker has been better than his. That said. An excellent performance in this movie. I think what people including myself have to separate the Heath performance as the Joker was already bat ? crazy in those movies. And n this movie it was showing the jokers decent into madness. And Phoenix does a fantastic job of doing that. I think that every person to take on this incredibly could mean complex role is not only risking career suicide but a laughing stalk if they get this one wrong. There's just too many eyes on dissecting every little thing Phoenix does. And of course he's taking a huge chance bringing a new joker in the wake of the performance by Heath Ledger. So you have to admit that took guts. I think Phoenix took his version of what the causes of his decent into madness.,Brad B,4

It took a few days for me to decide whether i actually enjoyed the movie.

10-Feb-20,"In these coddled times we live in, it becomes increasingly important to dive into the deep end of depravity and take a look at how dark things can go if left to their own demise. The acting is phenomenal, the plot thick, and I truly felt for the characters for a good week after viewing it. I appreciate and sign off on the Batman lore presented, and will be purchasing this movie when it comes out for my collection.",Justin R,5
10-Feb-20,"While I have to have respect for Joaquin Phoenix�s performance, the story itself is a dark narrative that offers no redeeming qualities. With a good dose of sudden and unrestrained violence the viewer is left with unnecessary images to live with, i.e. things one wishes they could unsee. Additionally the story leverages child abuse and mental illness as foundations for its trajectory.",,1.5
10-Feb-20,"While most may be thinking this is some sort of prequel to a caped crusader series, it is not. Joaquin Phoenix Delivers the best Acting performance I have seen in YEARS, and Joker is a new story that takes you down a dark psychopaths life view. My all time favorite movie.",Brandon M,5

10-Feb-20,"Im quite torn between a 5 star performance from Phoenix and a 2 star script from Phillips. While the movie gives a fantastic character study lead by Phoenix, the stylistic decisions are at many time boring and always expected and what Phillips is ""trying to say"" is at best muddled and at worst aimlessly jumping from one shallowly touched on social observation to the next.",Joshua L,3

The movie is worth seeing if just to witness Joaquin's deeply unsettling vision and interpretation of the Joker character.",James L,3
10-Feb-20,"When i found out that Todd Phillips was making a movie based on Joker, i immediately wanted to kill all the hype for the movie, this movie is coming from a guy that did dark comedies, and i really wanted to skip it, but god was i wrong. Todd Phillips wrote a beautiful script for the movie that's not attached or adapted from any comic, and this is an entire new origin story for the Joker character. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar worthy performance. This movie pays respect to Heath Ledger's Joker. Overall, JOKER was a great movie, and one of the best Comic Book Movies ever made.",Rustiq N,5

10-Feb-20,"This is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema that has graced the screen in years. This is a proper arthouse film that blends craftsmanship with source material. While it is supposedly a one-shot take on the Clown Prince of Crime, it does not ignore the source material to the extent that it is a whole new character, i.e. Will Smith as Deadshot -- Will Smith playing anyone is still Will Smith playing Will Smith playing [said character]. JOKER finds a balance between the creative ideas for the character and the character's long-winded history. This is a film worth seeing, if not for the empowerment of low-budget cinema, for the way Joaquin Phoenix inhabits his space. He becomes the character in simple ways, embracing everything about the broken man society forgot.",Bret B,4.5

10-Feb-20,"The definition of bad taste is having your hero, or anti-hero in this case, who suffered severe trauma and abuse as a child, have his triumphant moment set to ""Rock and Roll Part 2,"" the most famous song by Gary Glitter. Of course, long before then you'll know that Joker has no taste, no heart, and no brain. That wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't present itself as though it had meaningful subtext or social commentary. Instead this film thinks it is being edgy and shocking when it is actually so plainly mean and cruel and joyless that I found myself wanting to watch A Clockwork Orange as an antidote. This is a meanspirited film with no redeeming qualities, not even Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Yes, it is a good performance, and at this point Phoenix is a lock to win the Best Actor Oscar, but, frankly, I'm not surprised that an actor willing to sacrifice his career to make a fake documentary about becoming a rap star, I'm Still Here, gives a fully committed performance. That's just what Joaquin Phoenix does. Todd Phillips, who previously directed comedies like Old School and The Hangover, said in an interview with Vanity Fair that he cannot make comedies like he used to because of the current ""woke culture."" With that mindset he co-wrote and directed an origin story about Batman's most formidable villain, the Joker. This supposedly standalone film tells the story of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a working-class clown (literally) that is constantly treated poorly by everyone he encounters, humiliated, and even randomly beaten. Still, he dreams of being a comedian and meeting his idol, late night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). His shut-in mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) is the only warmth he experiences, but it turns out she has been hiding dark secrets from him. In addition to being meanspirited and misguided, Joker is also totally tone deaf. People of color are well represented in this version of Gotham: Arthur is senselessly beaten by a gang of Latino youths, his black female social worker is ineffectual, another black civil service worker won't help Arthur learn about his past, and a black woman on the bus and a black co-worker are just flat out rude to him. The one person of color kind to Arthur is his neighbor, played by Zazie Beetz, but her role is not what it seems and her fate, and the fate of her child, are left to grim implications. Of course, all of the white characters are also mean, rude, or obstacles for Arthur. The one decent person in the whole movie is Gary (Leigh Gill), a little person that works with Arthur at the clown precinct (complete with lockers and a punch card timeclock), but he is also the target of cruel jokes about his size both from other characters and the movie itself. Phillips's gripe with ""woke culture"" casts an extra dark pall over all of this. After Arthur loses his job and government funded medications for his mental illness, he reaches his breaking point when three Wall Street types beat him after menacingly singing ""Send in the Clowns"" at him. He shoots and kills them and the mysterious vigilante clown becomes an urban folk hero for some reason. The violent mob of ""protesters"" wearing clown masks he inspires consists of mostly, if not entirely, angry men. I'm not sure what to make of the one we see carrying a sign that says ""RESIST"" just before young Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered in front of him. That mob, angry at the wealthy, is reminiscent of the Occupy Wall Street movement, but that's just one example of several potentially provocative points that the movie introduces and never follows up on. If the standup comedy/talk show element sounds familiar that's because it is straight out of Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy, which starred Robert De Niro as a hack wannabe comedian obsessed with a late-night talk show host. If the working-class vigilante that has had it with the scum of the city sounds familiar that's because it is the basic plot of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, also starring Robert De Niro. Those movies featured anti-heroes with skewed perspectives on what they see every day, but unlike Joker those films take place in something resembling the real world. Scorsese lets us know that the world of those characters exists in a larger world to which they are not tuned in. Joker establishes firmly that its main character is someone with a serious mental illness that is not able to get the help he needs. When this character turns violent it should feel tragic but instead it is played as though this is a justified climatic triumph. This is an irresponsible and reprehensible film to say the least. Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is perfect example of a film about an ultra-violent, mentally disturbed anti-hero that successfully presents provocative and challenging ideas about society, civility, and free will. To sum up, I'll paraphrase the great critic Gene Siskel, which I think is only appropriate since Joker borrows so much from other films: Joker has the distinction of being one of the vilest and most contemptible films I've seen. This is a hateful movie. I want to hate it back but that means letting the Joker win, and as Batman said in The Dark Knight, ""the Joker cannot win.""",Armando G,0.5

09-Feb-20,"This was such a disappointment. It somehow messes up the best Batman villain in the comics while at the same time vilifying people with mental health issues. Also, it wants you to believe that it's like a prequel to Batman v Superman even though the theme of this film is NOTHING like Batman v Superman. It was hot garbage and the script and scenes reads like an edgelord listening to Marilyn Manson and scribbling out the ""forget to"" in a sign that says ""don't forget to smile"". At least the lead actor gives a good performance, even when given a trash script. The movie also made me laugh, unfortunately, it wasn't intended.",Logan C,0.5

08-Feb-20,"Ever since I watched this recently it hasn't left my head. Joker is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It shows Arthur Fleck finding his true self as Joker through dance, comedy, and murder. The music was lovely, and the acting was brilliant. The cinematography was beautifully put together. Joaquin Phoenix was a great choice as Joker in this movie. When I watched this movie for the first time, I could feel the suspense building up more and more as I watched it. Joker is a realistic rendition of the original Joker character who originally fell into a pit of acid. Definitely my favorite movie of all time at the moment. I wonder what masterpiece I'll watch next? ""If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" - Joker ( The Killing Joke )",Chayse L,5

08-Feb-20,"The hype on this film it was a problem for me because the movie is not bad at all, it is an interesting project and Joaquin Phoenix is ??superb but the script is a disaster, it lacks the sensitivity and subtlety of the work to which it intends to pay tribute, it is like a version for fools who stir on the same point in case someone has not understood what happen. The clown revolution is meaningless and the press of this fictional world is the most unlikely caricature, it knows what it wants to talk about but not how, making this social criticism empty in itself, concluding that he is a ""mental ill man"" who so he is very ""crazy"" and that is why he acts like this, because there is no change in the character, he is a man who continues to hallucinate and kill while still being medicated and who then continues to kill and hallucinate when he is not medicated (and yes i know he has a breaking point but after he kills the way he acts is so off he is medicated at this point) so all the part as criticizes the system health and budget cuts is in vain, the same goes for class criticism, when the only kind of violence that you know how to show from rich to poor is physical violence, without considering that those who initially hit you are social class low... you have a problem. But still it is an interesting proposal and removing those management problems the story itself is not bad, it's pretty good but It is not a masterpiece or even.",Karla M,3.5

07-Feb-20,"This last decade has thrown many, many superhero and supervillain movies at us, and, to be frank, it's become super boring. But Joker is a breath of fresh air. This is an origin movie that is able to shake off its supervillain story trappings by presenting us with a recognisable world. Todd's dystopic Gotham, with it's litter-strewn streets and excessive rioting, might seem like a fictional world, but the way in which a vulnerable man is repeatedly let down by society around him feels uncomfortably familiar. I think this is actually a reasonably misunderstood movie - by critics, anyway. Some suggest that the film glorifies violence and asks that we sympathise too greatly with this murderer. Some opine that it's a celebration of the far right. But as Micah Uetricht rightly states in his review of the film, Joker is in fact a condemnation of austerity, and of leaving the most vulnerable in society without care. I ask myself if snobbery is in play here. Is the misguided scrutiny from critics down to the fact this is a supervillain film, or perhaps due to the fact it's directed by the same guy who directed the Hangover films and worked on the story for Borat? Maybe so. In spite of the polarizing politics, several micro elements certainly deserve commendation: the cinematography and the score are particularly outstanding. Hildur Gudnadottir's cello-centred score, which is deeply moody and dark (and Oscar-worthy), and Lawrence Sher's self-assured use of colour, combine to give the film a notable, chilling atmosphere. Joaquin's Joker is a sensation and he captures everything from maniac to fragile. It's a physical performance, twisting his posture and contorting his face into a range of disturbing and memorable expressions. It's a consciously histrionic performance. Critics may debate the film's merit, but I think this is a deceptively smart film. Joaquin Phoenix's rendition of Joker is absolutely one that people will be talking about for years to come.",Jordan W,4.5
07-Feb-20,I watched the movie after i seen so many good reviews about it. I was dissapointed. It was not as good at all. The movie has alot of talking and there is not much action. It was so boring that my wife fell asleep. The actors are good but the problem is the story itself and how it was made. Everything seems slow and heavy. I was hoping to see more action.,Eric B,2

The story is great but its a little dry and slow. Still worth checking out.",Brian W,3.5
07-Feb-20,It really is an origin story of a man forced into madness because of society. While it isn't as light as the previous joker persona's in media at times. It truly exceeds in making a fitting story that evolves after watching it multiple times. And now it's grounded violence is some of the most hardcore we've seen from a while from DC. Truly a spectacle for those that can handle it.,Jordan B,5
07-Feb-20,"To put it plainly, this feels like a masterpiece but it isn't really yet still it moves like one. To have a movie about a character in a comic book world portray a message so important in the real world and almost necessary makes this somewhat A- yet masterfully directed and acted movie a masterpiece. 10 out of 10 for me and I will dare again and call it a masterpiece. Its view may scar you but more so it will make you wonder how much possible it is.",Nestory A,5
07-Feb-20,"Joker is testament to the monumental need for funding mental health services. With his leaky clown flower and greasy locks, Joaquin Phoenix is painfully good as the dark villain in this effective prequel to the Batman franchise.

06-Feb-20,I was very taken back by this movie mainly because of Joaquin Phoenix's performance. I had never seen him in any other movie before so I didn't know what to expect from him. He hits a home run with this and props to Todd Phililps for stepping out of his comfort zone going from a hit comedy in The Hangover also highly recommended to this really sad drama story of a man who is very lonely and has mental illness along with some other issues. You feel for the Joker and have a clear understanding of how he becomes the Joker by the end. Incredible acting and story telling. I only wish we got more of Joaquin as the Joker.,Brandon B,5

06-Feb-20,"I had heard from many people that this was a comic book movie for people that weren't fans of comic books. That irked me and was probably why I took so long to see it. I had also heard that it was harrowing and twisted, and while it is in a way, it was not an insufferable, punishing film, it was a great movie-going experience and a well made, unhurried, anti-studio film. Joker was a complete surprise, it's a true film of our time. Completely current and modern and on the pulse even with this retro flavour and backdrop of 70's exploitation inspired New York doubling for Gotham. As a fan of the comics, the bin strike, the rats, the trains, the divide between rich and poor, the look and feel of the film is a superb rendering of Gotham, better than every other and a far cry from the Heat-inspired Chicago-double in Nolan's films. On the subject of the city, I did see the film in a Dolby Atmos cinema, but the aural scape is truly rich and amazing, it should get an Oscar for its sound mix. And that's without commenting on the music, with reverent stings of The Dark Knight when appropriate, the whimsy is a unique kind, a dark twisted carnival of Fleck's mind. Hildur Gu�nad�ttir�'s score is the sound of the dissent, the sound of Joker's innards, it's not aggressive like Zimmer, it's sad and aching and lyrical as well as hideous. A friend had said before I watched it, that Joker was an origin story that gave explanation as to why The Batman doesn't just kill him, and instead wants to try and rehabilitate him. And he was right, the film is about a failing system, rich and poor divides, Inadequately supported mental illness, loneliness, lies, power, cult following, belongingness and being forgotten. It's not exclusively about violence or crazy. And both Batman and Joker were born of violence and connected in a myriad of possibilities. And it's the amount of plausible deniability at fan theories and the red herrings and questions surrounding the ending, that makes it such a clever movie. It could go anywhere within the canon of DC or exist on its own. It feels rather like a great one shot comic like The Killing Joke, it's through and through a comic book movie, except a reverent one, not content with converting and perverting the source material for maximum box office appeal and gains. Joaquin is obviously a powerhouse, he imbues his performance with such sadness and pathos that he's watchable in every scene and I'm made to feel so sorry for him and his conditions, even in the face of all of his deeds. And De Niro constantly reminds me how good he is whenever I forget. I was at a Q&A with Director Todd Phillips and he noted again that when Obama was elected he made three hangover films. When Trump was elected he made Joker. This is a film we need right now.",Sean S,5

05-Feb-20,This was just ok to me. The dialogue wasn't that great and this for sure wasn't even close to my favorite portrayal of the joker. I expected it to be darker. Just didn't live up to the hype.,Shawn T,3
05-Feb-20,This movie was everything I'd hoped and more. It was a collaborative success from every area of production and performance. One of my all time faves.,Lana B,5
05-Feb-20,"The fact that this movie disturbs and even angers some people is part of its power. It shows us the ugly aspects of society �urban society, specifically. and human society, generally. The fearful and the ruthless, the careful and the careless, the givers and takers, infused with the impulsive behavior triggered by too much pressure, overcrowding, external and internal noise, competition for resources and riches, and lack of compassion or accountability.",John H,4
04-Feb-20,A flawless performance from Phoenix carries a terrifyingly realistic origin story of comic books' greatest villain.,Kevin R,5
04-Feb-20,"Joker is a new take on the origin story of the Joker. It's part character study, part tragedy and in my opinion, is absolutely brilliant. It is a master class of cinematography, story telling and acting. It allows the viewer to have uncomfortable conflicting feelings, for example; empathy and repulsion, because it doesn't tell you what to think or how to feel. The film allows the viewer to formulate their own feelings and opinions, which is not only refreshing but desperately lacking in current films/television, which is something I feel audiences will really appreciate.",ivy m,5

04-Feb-20,"A bad knockoff of King Of Comedy. I'm surprised DeNiro would sign on for this. It's a travesty. The character development is poor and the film is very unrealistic, given that it's allegedly trying to put some realism into the Joker's story. I've seen much worse movies, but this was still definitely a waste of time. Don't watch.",Damian J,2

04-Feb-20,"At first I didn't think that I would like this movie because it looked like it was going to be creepy from the trailer. Surprisingly, it wasn't but it was very dark and depressing because the Joker went through a life of failure and disappointment. He believes the world is corrupt and that there are no good people in this world. That's someone with a lot of issues. Even though the movie was just a little better than I thought I don't really recommend seeing it.",Michael W,3

I thought that J. Phoenix did a good job playing Joker but this movie was kinda dark and kinda grim a little to depressing for my taste. I have only watched it once and I don't think I would watch it again I might, but I didn't really understand or get this movie. I felt bad for him and I understand where the character was coming from and what he went through but idk about this movie.",Alexsis D,2

03-Feb-20,"Gritty and quite realistic for a fantasy genre. Brilliant acting of a character descending into a personal hell,but somehow raising above it. We seem to be living in an era of anti establishment heros and this film seems to be a defining of an era movie.",Vince R,4

03-Feb-20,Great movie. Phoenix's acting was haunting. The movie was suspenseful and was a must watch.,Lauren R,5
03-Feb-20,"Joaquin Phoenix is my new favorite Joker. Everything about this movie is expertly crafted, and film buffs will likely want to watch multiple times. I'm not going to ruin it by saying too much about it, so just press play and enjoy.",David J,5
03-Feb-20,"In terms of directing, it's a spot on. Todd Phillips smoothly guides Joaquin Phenix into an incredible believable madness and takes you along the ride. All supporting actors, no matter how small the role, did also a great job. I loved to see Robert De Niro back into acting, not just making a ""Robert De Niro impression"". Now let's talk cinematography, well, I honestly think that Lawrence Sher deserves an Oscar, or at least some type of recognition. He just creates the perfect atmosphere: the choice of lens, the color spectrum used, the angles, etc. I also want to mention that the whole team has done a great job to create a timeless cinematic experience. I think there must be very few teams (acting, directing, producing, sound engineering, etc) in the industry, not just now, who could get together and give us such a master piece. On paper it might seem a long movie, but just after the first very few minutes you're hooked until the final credits are on the screen. Go and treat yourself for a real cinematic experience.",Fernando S,5

02-Feb-20,"Tke most interesting and intense movie ever had the dark pleasure and fun ever of any of the 3( + movies I've watched it (7 times so) Masterpiece is such an understatent. I'll will be getting my 4k blu-ray copy next week from mow making it even more amazing. Eternal Sunshine on Spotless Mind used to be my favorite, but this gem suprases it in so many way. The story, the amzing acting and the brilliant score makes it a must see for anyone with even a mocicum in imrest in films. Whether you're mentally ill, know someone who is or just feel disillusioned from society as a whole, this movie, of you have a modicum of empathy towards fellow humans who struggle with life, this movie is bound to make you ctu and feel despair and hope.

02-Feb-20,"Interesting character study into the mind of a madman that takes you on a completely different journey of the character than you'd think you would want. A ""what if"" Martin Scorsese did a comic book film. But I'm a little puzzled at the amount of Oscar recognition it has received. Sure it's a decent film but not on par with Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, Ford vs Ferrari, Judy.......or even Dr Sleep........Joaquin Phoenix will likely take home the Oscar, though I don't think the performance truly deserves it",Andrew R,3
02-Feb-20,Slow dark depressing film. Dark demented deranged killer clown. No thanks.,,2
02-Feb-20,"Phoenix a single-handedly revived DC with his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. Every scene is shot incredibly well and really visualizes Arthur's descent into madness. Almost every scene puts you on edge, making you feel constantly uncomfortable. Todd Phillip's direction was fantastic, allowing scenes to breathe while also keeping a tight grip on the main point. Every character served a purpose and contributed to creation of the Joker. The score was used to enhance the story. The movie could create an eerie atmosphere with just music alone. This is my all-time favorite movie, and just an incredible piece of Cinema!",,5

02-Feb-20,"This movie is exceptionally slow, Phoenix is a great actor who is wasted in what might be the worst of any of the DC movies. It attempts to be edgy and artistic and ends up boring. I made it through the whole thing, but it was 2 hours I will never get back.",Ali S,0.5

01-Feb-20,A raw yet contained depiction of a mans struggle to fit in to society. A man who day dreams of being treated kindly by people whom are his only world. A tv show host. An audience who would usually misjudge him. A matter if timing and karma. A tale as old as time. Incredibly well told. Much needed. A film that feels like a film. Thank goodness.

01-Feb-20,"Joker... it's an total masterpice and an triumph, not just for DC, for all the comicbook adaptation.

31-Jan-20,"I'm speechless. This is one of my favorite movies of the year, and it's the best. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Yes, I think he should absolutely win an Oscar for his portrayal as the iconic character. Heath Ledger is still my favorite Joker, but Joaquin is pretty close to the level of Ledger. Todd Phillips did a phenomenal job directing, I think this is his best work to date. Robert De Niro is not given much screen time, but he takes advantage of the time he's given, and he shines. The costume design and makeup is great as well, and I think it should be nominated for a major award. The script is incredible, I'm going to be quoting a lot of the lines for days. The violence in this movie was not even that bad, compared to other films that have had this amount of controversy. I would like to take a minute and say, that films and other media do not cause violence, this is not a ""dangerous film."" The last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely insane, I won't be able to forget them. The death scene on the Murray Franklin Show, is absolutely crazy, and I did not see it coming. Despite the fact that Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mass murderer, I couldn't help but feel bad for his character at times. I didn't forgive him for the things he did, but at the same time, I did sympathize with him. I really liked the progression of Arthur's character. You see him slowly growing more and more insane as the seconds go by. The runtime was perfect it never felt boring. I loved this movie, and there's so much more I want to talk about.",Tyler K,5
31-Jan-20,Joker provides a strong perfomance from Phoenix and makes for one hell of a strong movie. In my opinion could possibly be the best film of 2019.,,5

Joaquin's acting is second to none, literally give the guy all the awards for this performance. This movie is a must see for all. Even if you are not a comic book movie fan or hate Batman lore this movie still stands on its own with amazing story telling, superb acting and jaw dropping climax. Love this film. Thank you Todd Phillips.",ZG L,5
30-Jan-20,"He put so much effort into acting in this movie, it�s insane!!",,5
30-Jan-20,"""Joker"" is a supremely well-crafted piece of art. I saw this film with no expectations in a nearly empty theater in January, months after the hype had died down. I'm not a DC fan, and I had no knowledge of the comic book universe prior to this film, and yet, I was completely blown away. I was still thinking about it for days after. ""Joker"" had really left an impression. I was successfully pulled into the film by the colors and atmospheres of the bleak and dismal dystopia Gotham City that were captured and presented masterfully through the cinematography. Every shot of this film is a painting. The sinister and striking face-paint with the blue tear streaming down the left eye, along with the crimson two-piece, golden waistcoat and sea-green buttondown are fashionably villainous and nothing short of iconic. But that's just the style, let's get into the substance. Never before had I seen a film that touched me so viscerally. My heart was aching, it was thumping, and it was breaking. Joaquin Phoenix disappears, as he transcends acting and embodies Arthur Fleck. Phoenix's spellbinding performance is not only what carries most of the film, but what skyrockets it into greatness. The tragically beautiful string compositions by Hildur Gu�nad�ttir not only act as another main character but add so many layers of depth and nuance to the experience. This film immerses you into Arthur's world and brings you intimately, and oftentimes uncomfortably, close to him. ""Joker"" isn't shy, and touches on topics such as class warfare, fake media, and fanaticism; but all of these are peripheral, with the main focus being on mental health, recognition, and the absence of empathy. All that Arthur wants in his life is to feel seen, and feel loved, only to live a lonely life of continuous bullying and ostracization due to circumstances beyond his control. As somebody with poor mental health, the depictions of depression and struggling with mental health really resonated with me, and it was liberating and validating to see that represented on the big screen. Never before have I seen a film that so poignantly captures the devastating feelings of being helpless, hopeless, and alone that come with mental illness. We follow along with Arthur as he swirls in a downward spiral after being beaten down, neglected, and forgotten by society. We watch as he desperately tries to find some sense of self, trying to break out of the invisibility that surrounds his existence. Not only until Arthur Fleck dies in a slow burn and is reborn as the Joker is he ever truly, unapologetically himself. ""Joker"" is a powerful, unforgettable film, that will spark wild emotions and introspective thought within anyone who sees what it is trying to say. It is not a perfect film. Some of the dialogue is on-the-nose, and some of the plot points are predictable, but I excuse these flaws from my overall appreciation of the film as I find the rest of it to be absolutely superb. If you struggle with mental health or loneliness, or even just feeling misunderstood, you may find the representation in Arthur to be refreshing and validating. ""Joker"" is an eye-opening experience that demonstrates what happens in a world devoid of kindness and understanding. I walked away from the film with this message: You never know what people are going through, so you should always try to be kind. Look out for each other. If someone had cared for Arthur, he could have been saved. Do not write people off or discard people, not out of fear that they may become the next ""Joker"", but because every person deserves human decency, and everyone deserves to be acknowledged as a human being. No human is worthless. It is important to hear people out, and give them a chance, and if you can, be there for them. Listen. Care. Try to understand. Understanding leads to acceptance, which leads to love.",Jude G,5
30-Jan-20,"Wow, this movie kept the discussions going long after the credits stopped rolling. I'm not usually interested in super hero/joker movies, but when I heard its completely unrelated to all of that, I thought I'd give it a go and I was not disappointed. This movie was thrilling, disturbing, shocking at times and dark. I felt like I kept trying to guess throughout the movie what was real and what wasn't. At times it became confusing but that's what made it all the more fun. I really enjoyed how it addressed mental illness throughout the movie and also learning more about the back story to the joker. Throughout the movie you feel a whole range of emotions especially for the main character. I felt sympathy for him at times but also scared of him at the same time, it was quite conflicting. On a final note I think Joaquin Pheonix deserves a standing ovation for his performance!",Vinncent M,4
30-Jan-20,I think the critics have zero understanding of what makes a good movie.,Seth B,5
30-Jan-20,"Tries very, very hard to be an uncomfortable, philosophically-charged character study on mental illness and 'the system, mannn'.

30-Jan-20,I only give it one star and thats for makeup and because I like Joaquin Phoenix as a person. Otherwise it was awful and awfully long. There was no story the just people being mean to a guy. No Story. You have to have a story or the movie sucks.,mike w,1

A satire on the stand-up insanity, Marvel movie dross, TV comedy hosts on late night tv, corrupt America, the contributions of Robin Williams, Jim Carey & Charlie Chaplin to civilisation, with references to Taxi Driver, Midnight Cowboy & Network. Serious film representing good theatre and writing is back....I hope. Phoenix is superb. I did not want to take my eyes off him in case I missed a facial twitch or expression. He builds on Heath Ledger's Joker and takes it to the stratosphere and beyond. It will be too close to home for a lot of Americans who don't want to face up to obscene wealth, homelessness, mental illness, poor medical cover and gun insanity. But see it.....it's marvellous!

28-Jan-20,The worst movie in the Batman Collection...Terrible acting throughout the movie...,Patrick M,0.5
28-Jan-20,"Uncomfortable close-ups with a broken man, struggling to cope in a broken city, without a flicker of hope from a broken society. Set in the very early 1980s, Joker goes out of its way to invoke all the dirt and grime of that era. The local news, the regional politics, the dark sense of a brooding civil discontent, it's all here, and not only are we transported back to an age that could've easily spawned such a fractured criminal figurehead, we're shown direct parallels in today's seemingly polished outward-facing veneer. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing in that lead role, carrying the picture in an essential performance that alternately wows and disturbs. He wrings every last drop of power out of a difficult part, creating a beautiful sense of poetic, unsettling discord that's tough to watch but even tougher to tear one's eyes from. Even if we can't endorse his actions (the film also stops short of doing so), we can understand the series of tragic missteps that led up to them, and maybe identify a shard of that same mania tucked away in our own subconscious. It's both literal and metaphorical, concrete but ethereal. We never know if what we're seeing takes place in reality or in a hyper-realistic, drug-induced sense of imagination, as the two are so hopelessly, constantly intertwined. There's a logical explanation for almost every last one of the character's trademark quirks, most of the heartbreaking variety (particularly that violent, wrenching laugh), but are those the truth or more figments? Daring and ugly and spontaneously violent (the deaths in this film are shocking in their immediate finality), it's the kind of movie that stomps your teeth into the concrete and leaves you wondering where it all went wrong. The post-climax is a weakness, perhaps, its messaging too blunt and transparent, but that's a rather small gripe. I've been thinking about it all weekend.",Sean L,4

28-Jan-20,"What a depressing movie. Joaquin Phoenix was terrific, but do we really need a biopic that is sympathetic to such depravity? For me, the writer-director's attempt at social commentary misses the mark badly: Hollywood really doesn't understand the common man's disillusion, or perhaps it simply exercises poor judgment in its violent depictions of populism. The Joker is a comic-book villain in an exaggerated comic-book work--he's not your down-and-out-neighbor who flipped a switch.",Ryan L,3

27-Jan-20,"ok, let's talk about Joker, probably the most amazing movie of recent times. This film is very different, it's a very different storyline. The script is very well written, it demonstrates well the mental insanity of the protagonist, which propagates in the dialogues. Todd Phillips' direction is very well done, obviously it is a very different job compared to his work on The Hangover, here his direction is invasive and cautious. We can not fail to mention the magnificent and anthological performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who is sensational, it is really difficult to express words to describe this fantastic performance. Another incredible point of the film is its soundtrack, which is very good and deserves to win an Oscar. Joker is a very heavy film, it really is not for anyone. The film presents the basic coalitions with the D.C universe, but the focus in this film is really the presentation of the origin of the joker. I will make a small mention of Robert de Niro's performance, which despite doing a simple and basic performance, is an interesting performance that has a lot to do with the main character's arc. To conclude, Joker is a film that, despite being very heavy, is a beautiful character study, with a very good script, and a magnificent performance by Joaquin Phoenix.",Leonardo T,5

Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant in his performance, and no one can deny that. I did not like the political statement it tried to make. I also didn't like how they tried to shoe horn the Wayne family into this. It felt kind of forced.

25-Jan-20,"""Why so (self-)serious?"" Todd Phillip's JOKER is exactly what I expected it to be. It's a great showcase of Joaquin Phoenix' acting prowess as he delves into a character and contorts himself emotionally and physically, becoming a distillation of our morbid and troubled times. It's also Phillips' attempt to capture the magic of Martin Scorcese's 70's output, namely THE KING OF COMEDY and TAXI DRIVER, then releasing it in a modern sociopolitical context to comment on mass shootings and the Occupy movement...and failing to say anything of substance about those things. Well what did you expect? It's still just a comic book movie and a somewhat boring one at that. If you ran the slow motion sequences (which mostly consist of Phoenix grooving on the steps from THE EXORCIST to your favorite 60's cuts) at regular speed, the film would just barely hit the 90 minute mark, but OH NO you're gonna watch him dance and you're gonna like it! It's supposed to be poignant too, so make sure you wallow in Arthur Fleck's ""mental illness"" and sympathize with him, not for the fundamentals of his character but rather because of the society that victimized him to the point of becoming a homicidal maniac. This is not to fault the storytelling here because it is as plausible a scenario for creating the iconic Joker character as any you will find. However, what it says of mass shootings and their correlation to a certain demographic (one that I happen to be a member of) is the equivalent of a Fox News anchor chiding mental health services for the Las Vegas massacre. Uh, yeah, there's more we could do for people struggling with psychological issues, but handing out more pills and scheduling extra therapy sessions has nothing to do with how anyone outside of active military, much less a suicidal compulsive gambler could stockpile 23 rifles, 15 of which were outfitted with bump fire stocks. Obviously, this issue is more complicated than one movie could attempt to address, but it makes Phillip's nihilistic (and I rarely use this word unless I mean it) take that much more pretentious - and to some degree exploitative. Knowing that you can market something because it's sure to rustle some jimmies requires a modicum of social responsibility, and here it is executed joylessly and largely without any true insight into its broader implications. But, hey, it is directed by the guy who gave us THE HANGOVER trilogy, so that's no big surprise. If I wanted to see a violent, conflicted anti-Hero played by Joaquin Phoenix teeter on the borderline of sanity, I'd just watch YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE again. But even as a Batman spinoff film, I can't help but think most genre fans will be bored and leave the theater a little more depressed than when they came in. As for the fear that this movie will spur something like the Aurora theater shootings hearkening back to the release of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, I'm doubtful that this film will serve as anything more than a leaking tap to the building frustrations of those who were already planning some violent public demonstration.",Steve L,2.5
25-Jan-20,Hard to rate this one. The acting is superb but it is so dark and violent. The takeaway for me is that mental illness is so very neglected in our society and that message needs to be repeated but this portrayal is horrible!,iris f,2

It is perfectly paced and has the best type of build which is slow. The character is well built and I was routing for him until well after the middle part when he loses it. I feel like this is a perfect butterfly effect analogy as all goes to hell with one move made by a co worker. His first screw up is all out of his own safety and screws him over and watching his mental diseases get to him.,Shawn L,5
25-Jan-20,This movie was aweful. Ruined the whole joker character! Joaquins acting was pretty good. Typically love Todd Philips movies but this one sucked hard! The underlying message was pretty pathetic and sad. Cant believe he could not see the fail here - zero vision for the Joker!,,0.5

Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the Joker and masterfully portrays the mentally ill criminal damaged by society and the effects of his upbringing.

24-Jan-20,"This movie is sick. It's dark, ugly, and bleak. A sympathetic portrait is painted of an arch-villain. Todd Phillips appears to be justifying Joker's later villainy, showing a nice guy being abused and literally beaten up. And, yes, this is the story of a villain. Let me repeat that, this is the story of a villain. This movie also looks like a rip-off of ""Taxi Driver,"" only with a far less subtle portrayal by the lead character. Finally, it's fair to ask, what is the pleasure in watching the movie? What exactly did people like who praised ""Joker""?

24-Jan-20,"Well, I FINALLY got around to seeing the controversial and wildly popular film, Joker: the most profitable comic book movie and the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. Now, I intentionally avoided seeing this movie when it came out. Not because I wasn't interested in seeing it or because I thought I wouldn't like it, but because of the hype and the controversy. Seemingly, all the reactions were either ""If you like this movie, you're an incel and a school shooter!"" or ""If you don't like this movie, you're an SJW and a shill!"" and I just hate that black-and-white mentality when it comes to movies, or anything really. I find it really obnoxious. I was sick of hearing about it everywhere so I just stayed away. However, months later, the hype has died down, no one has gotten shot or killed because of this movie and it's finishing its theatrical run. I paid $5 and saw it at the second-run theatre. What did I think of it? I loved it, but this movie is not perfect. I'll get the negatives out of the way first since there aren't a lot of them. I thought the writing was way too unsubtle, obvious and on-the-nose. This film is very clear about what it is saying and it hits you on the head with it, almost like they're dumbing it down for audiences who aren't used to watching introspective dramas like this and otherwise wouldn't if it weren't based on a famous comic book supervillain. It can make you roll your eyes sometimes. There weren't too many of those moments for me, but your mileage my vary. Also, there really was no point in setting this in the late 70s/early 80s. I know it's paying homage to famous Joker stories from the 80s like The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns, as well as Martin Scorsese movies from the 70s and 80s like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but you can do an homage without making a period piece. You could set the story in modern-day and it wouldn't change at all. In fact, some things would make more sense if it were set in a world of social media and mobile phones. You'll see what I mean if you see the movie. I also think some aspects of this movie would've been stronger if they showed rather than told. This movie needed more flashbacks, it would've been way more powerful. However, with all that said, I still loved it. I thought it was great. This movie is not fast. It's not fun. There isn't much action or comedy. It's darker and more serious than The Dark Knight. Just know that going in. This is not your typical comic book movie. It's more A History of Violence than The Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the titular character is INCREDIBLE. He's both sympathetic and scary and adds so many little nuances and special touches to his performance to make it completely his own. This Joker is very much unlike any other Joker we've gotten in other movies. It was refreshing, especially after the Suicide Squad fiasco. A lot of the other performers aren't half bad either, it was cool to see Robert DeNiro in a comic book movie. This movie is beautiful. It's shot really well and I loved the setdressing. Everything is dirty and grimy and disgusting with garbage everywhere, we're a long way from the Gotham City of Joel Schumacher's Batman movies! The score was also haunting and beautiful, with some great music choices for the soundtrack. No Twenty One Pilots here! I also thought this movie was really thematically rich and relevant. It has tons of social commentary about mental health, class, bullying, abuse, trauma, social isolation, gun violence, the media and more. Some might say this film bites off more than it can chew, it does try to juggle a lot of different themes at once, but I think it worked. This movie also connects with the larger mythology of Batman in very clever ways, leaving the door open to possible sequels and spinoffs. I don't want that, personally, but it's cool that this movie is also a Batman origin story, in a way. Joker and Batman are still two parts of a whole, even in Joker's own movie. Overall, Joker is a flawed but great movie. It's not for everyone and I definitely understand where a lot of the criticism of the film itself is coming from, but I still loved it and recommend it to any fan of psychological character studies or crime dramas, not just superhero movies. I hope it wins some Oscars!",Aidan Z,4
24-Jan-20,"This movie is unlike any other comicbook-based film in that it feels frighteningly real. Phoenix absolutely steals the movie with his performance as the Joker. I believe it is a performance that the late Health Ledger would applaud!

23-Jan-20,"Amazing movie and amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He and Todd Phillips absolutely knocked this one out of the park! This movie made me feel so many different things: discomfort, empathy, shock, sadness, laughter and I couldn't stop thinking about this movie after I watched it and had to give it another go just to look at it with a different perspective. This movie made me feel like we need to be more empathetic to others in our society. Fantastic score and cinematography as well, but the true stand-out is Phoenix's performance, one that may even top Ledger's!",Amanda V,5
23-Jan-20,Amazing job by Joaquin Phoenix! Had me mesmerized! Had to watch it twice!,Carol S,5
23-Jan-20,2 days after sawing Joker i was still out of my mind from what i saw. This movie is something special for me and definitely for many other people too. There is everything great from soundtrack to absolutely perfect story and even hundred times better than that Joaquin Pheonix in leading role. Performance is amazing and I'm really looking forward to the Oscars.,Adam K,5
23-Jan-20,"Dark. Clever. Realistic. Brutal. Director Todd Phillips knocks it out of the park with a grand slam! Joaquin Phoenix gives a mesmerizing, masterful, wiry raw performance. This Joker has been redefined into a category all it's own. As with Heath Ledger's award winning interpretation of the character in a super-hero type vehicle, this film is none of that by the way, Phoenix deserves several viewings to discover all the intricate nuances of his character. Re-viewing of Taxi Driver and especially The King of Comedy is highly recommended before seeing this movie as Martin Scorsese's references are all over this film. Again, this IS NOT a super hero spectacular, but a study in human frailty. 10/10.",Atom B,5

23-Jan-20,"This is a very well done film. Its scarily realistic and Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic. This film is less of a superhero film, instead it's actually a fantastically crafted film.",Brett M,4
23-Jan-20,"Although the unreliable narrator makes it hard for viewers to tell reality from fantasy, it's competent treatment of hot-button themes like gun control and mental health makes ""Joker"" a film that captures the spirit of an era in which so many feel marginalized and expendable.",Alli A,4.5
23-Jan-20,"'Joker' was a dark, thrilling, and brilliant film that made you go 'wow'. The film brought out such fear and disturbance that you typically wouldn't see in these types of superhero movies. The acting was just PHENOMENAL. Joaquin Phoenix (Joker/Arthur Fleck) had one of the best most spectacular performances of the year! It was a perfect display of mental illness and sometimes you can just FEEL what the Joker was going through as Phoenix displays such amazing raw talent. I also believe Robert De Niro displayed a good performance as well as acting as Murray Franklin, a popular talk-show host. He really felt like an actual talk show host and his acting towards the end was fantastic. 'Joker' excels greatly in certain scenes, especially towards the end. To avoid spoilers, the scenes towards the end of the film is just ASTONISHING. It's worth watching on its own! The camerawork and music cues were splendid as well. Otherwise, it's one of, if not, the best film of 2019. The critics' reviews are honestly questionable at a glance. To conclude, THIS FILM WAS FLAT-OUT ASTOUNDING AND TERRIFYING!",Derrick N,5
23-Jan-20,"this is a very bad movie; a sick, sorry, pathetic, disgusting, repulsive, repugnant movie.

23-Jan-20,A one note ridiculously depressing half movie. Apollo shallow and possibly the most overrated crapfest in a long time.,Thomas M,1
23-Jan-20,"Joaquin is nothing short of brilliant in this. It's a haunting portrayal of a broken mind spiraling into madness in a decaying city. I loved the way everything was handled, but I wasn't gaga over the end product for some reason. I think finally seeing it soo late was the culprit, all these months of overhype can work to lessen the impact of a piece of art. I'm almost certain I'll fall in love with this movie even more with subsequent viewings, when my expectations are in check.",,4
23-Jan-20,"I'd like to separate this film from any of the 100's of slasher movies but I can not. Although the script attempted to give more depth and understanding of the motives of the unfortunately deranged and violent among us, it barely scratched the surface of the subject matter. Story has little redeeming features except to portray mental illness in its worst light. At best the story might be a lesson to us all to live our lives with acts of love and compassion. Having said that, the scenes and images were captivating and I Joaquin Phoenix gave an ""all in"" physical and mental commitment to his performance, which may be worthy of an Oscar along with the original sound score. This film is not for everyone, especially the faint of heart.",Richard B,3.5

22-Jan-20,Acting is amazing. Movie is just mehh,,2.5
22-Jan-20,"Joaquin Phoenix put forward a fantastic performance that was certainly memorable. The overall quality of the film, however, was slightly above average. It was good, not great. The plot was very straightforward, and didn't do anything interesting. As controversial as this movie became in the media, I found its overall plot progression to be fairly status quo and boring. It's a story that's been told many, many times...this time it had a slight coat of Batman paint over the top. There's one moment that I THINK was supposed to be a big reveal, yet I saw it coming from the very beginning of the film. Joaquin Phoenix's performance aside, the dialogue was honestly quite dull as well. Again I think the movie was a solid GOOD, but I completely disagree with it being Academy-worthy as an overall film. Phoenix's individual performance deserves a Best Actor nod, but the film itself didn't deserve the nod for Best Picture or Best Director. I am especially upset about this because my favorite movie of the year (aside from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) was Knives Out. Knives Out is CERTAINLY Academy-worthy as an overall film and was masterfully directed (and written) by Rian Johnson. The fact that it lost nominations in those categories to Joker is absolutely ridiculous. I think the Academy was simply following the money and going with the big money-maker of the year.",TJ R,3

22-Jan-20,This is an origin story for a comic book character. Ignore the critics who scored this movie low because their presumptions were not met. Gotham City is fictional.

22-Jan-20,"The worst thing I could say about the Joker would just be me nitpicking an incredibly well-executed movie. I was genuinely doubting my sanity walking out of this movie: ""Did I really just shed tears for the Joker?!""",Adam L,4.5
22-Jan-20,Joaquin Phoenix puts on a legendary performance that's undeniably dark and uncomfortable. The dissent into madness that slowly builds over time is captured in ways that seems all too familiar in today's modern era. The story of the Joker is still without a true origin story in the comics and this adaptation is one of the best in terms of origin. I especially enjoyed the Wayne family tie in and was executed (pun) very well. Overall this was a massively dark story with amazing performances that shines a light on the truth of mental health and character development,Chad S,5
22-Jan-20,Great movie. Great performances,Stephen H,5
22-Jan-20,"I've never had a movie make me feel the same way as Joker. More so, one performance. The sheer intensity and delusion of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal gave enough power to have me quiet for the proceeding couple days after seeing this film. Yes, Joker had a few technical problems, but I've never had a film captivate my eyes over a few specific elements. Joker is a must-see (if you're up for the pain).",Sam B,4.5

21-Jan-20,"Most of the general audience love the new joker while it doesn't please the critics as much as people want. Why is the latest joker film so popular? Because it's easy to watch, emotional by the use of music and attractive visual effects. All it is to do is to win sympathy from the audience, going into tedious details about the joker's biography, creating events that victimising him, etc. while the events are just simply street bullying, losing his job out of injustice, disillusioned with the wrong belief that he's the son of the richest man in town. It shows details of his sick and strange behaviours which draw no more than your sympathy. The most powerful and also horrible thing of the joker should be his idea, which is unfortunately the weakest in this latest joker film. he may have some misfortune in his life that has driven him crazy, but his craziness should have also been his ""charm"" and not just a victimised thing. And his charm is linked mainly to his ideology. In the film we only see a random mental patient, a random nut which we can pick in the street in any society in everyday life. It is just another story of ""taxi driver"", only with different social backgrounds and personal encountering. What I despise most about the film is it uses all simple and plain techniques to lure common audience to fall in love with the atmosphere of the film. Compare to great works like ""taxi driver"", or the joker in the dark knight, this new joker just talk very simple philosophy of his own. The longest speech which perhaps reveals the most of his thoughts is during the talk show, but the script is poorly filled with complaints like ""oh no why nobody walks into other people's shoes? Oh why nobody cares about my existence?"" as if an immature child bursts in long suppressed emotion and keep nagging about his bad luck. There may be one or two good lines like questioning the definition of what's funny and what's not; it's an idea about who defines the world. But what next? What's his plan and agenda to change this social order? How is he going to reshape the world according to his definition? The joker in dark knight becomes real villain because he walks the talk to upheaval the world. His plan is done according to the idea in his mind. While talking about his childhood story we also have a glimpse of his misfortune and sickness which have transformed into what a freak he is now. His craziness is beyond our expectation because he's a genius at the same time. In contrast, the new joker is easy to control, because he looks just like any other violent psychopaths locked in the hospital. The most ""horrible"" thing he can do seems to be just killing people suddenly, or even just ""accidentally"".",Mung Y,2

21-Jan-20,"Brilliant acting from Joaquin Phoenix. Certainly a strong Best Actor candidate. Movie is aesthetically gorgeous, as is the cinematography. It's dark in all the best ways. You really feel like you're in the grimy, poverty-ridden Gotham City depicted in the film as you watch it. The writing is solid in terms of pacing/dialogue, but the storyline is a bit heavy-handed on the social commentary and it's essentially a knockoff of Taxi Driver, albeit a very good knockoff. Plus, Phillips gets points for creating a brand new Joker origin story that works as a standalone film outside of the DC/Batman universe canon, but also feels like a realistic starting point for the comic book Joker and some of the other Jokers we've seen portrayed on film, most notably Heath Ledger's brilliant performance. I could certainly see the sequel connecting (some of) the dots between the end of Joker and what's eventually seen as the character we love from The Dark Knight.",Zach B,4.5

20-Jan-20,"I tried to go into this film without recalling all of the controversy swirling around it and the negative comments I had seen on the internet but five minutes into the film I found myself agreeing with most of their criticisms. The film's biggest flaw is that it steals from a lot of successful films from the 1970s with Network (1976) and Taxi Driver (1976) coming to mind but takes the wrong messages from both. It pretends to be about important issues like the poor treatment of the mentally ill in society and the media's glorification of violent figures but it does not say anything of value about these problems and instead uses vaguely referencing these ideas to defend itself against attacks of being empty and meaningless. Unsuccessful clown Arthur Fleck, Joaquin Phoenix, lives with his mother in a small, rundown apartment in New York City and is regularly assaulted while doing his job. He is incensed when the government sponsored therapist he has been receiving treatment from is no longer able to work with him as the city no longer sponsors treatment for the mentally ill. One night Fleck shoots three businessmen on a subway and this case become newsworthy and inspires several other angry men to commit similar crimes. Fleck also pursues a career as a standup comic and when he is mocked by his idol, Murray Franklin, Robert De Niro, on his talk show he decides to take drastic action. Part of what makes watching the film so frustrating is that it wears it's references on it's sleeve so clearly that it is difficult not to recall the wonder of The King of Comedy (1982) and then roll your eyes at that the imitation found in this film. Much like that film we get a protagonist who lives with his mother and spends most of his time in a fantasy land in which he engages with a famed talk show host who he has long imaginary conversations with. Where that film let us become disturbed as Rupert Pupkin converses with cardboard cut outs before having his difficult situation reinforced by hearing his unseen mother yelling at him from upstairs. This film gives us many scenes of Fleck's mother rambling on about her affair with Wayne and scenes in which we see Franklin talking to him in his fantasies. In the first film we are left to wonder about how often Pupkin does these things and what his relationship with his mother is like and what we imagine is more scary than anything we could actually see. This film just comes out and shows you everything that should be implied and it makes you less terrified of our isolated main character as the film's presentation of his dream world is less terrifying than just the implication would have been. Phillips applies everything so thickly in the film with nothing being left open to interpretation deliberately and each point being made multiple times to the point of redundancy. Having said this I also feel like he does not know quite what he wants to say as he paints �society', represented by the wealthy snobs like Wayne and laughing street toughs who steal signs, as evil and accuses them of creating a figure like the Joker but simultaneously tries to indict a figure like him. His second effort does not work as I can just imagine the wrong audience watching the film and feeling triumphant during the scenes in which Fleck shoots Franklin live on air and witnesses other lonely, isolated people committing acts of vandalism and revels in his newfound power. The music that Phillips chooses to play during these scenes and the way that Phoenix is shot as though as he is a godlike figure makes me think that the film applauds his actions. I walked away from the film feeling cheated as the film condones abuse and violence and presents it as a way that men like Fleck can escape from having no power and suffering from mental health issues. There are a few scenes that give some context to Fleck's issues as he notes that he feels better when he is not taking his medication. From my limited experience with people who have to take anti depressants they have discussed the fact that taking them makes them feel like people do not care about them and do not want them to be who they truly are. Then the film turns away from what could have been an interesting road to go down and goes back to supporting Fleck's despicable actions. Men who are wounded by not experiencing enough social interaction should turn to treatment and help from others rather than killing people or vandalizing stores and this film does not have the sophistication to actually show how to help those who face these problems.",Catherine S,1

20-Jan-20,"A movie I've had to sit on for several days and I think I'll have to sit on even longer. Controversial, dangerous, these are words thrown around a lot with this movie. I guess I see why, but maybe not for the right reason. It's asking questions, but a lot of people are getting the wrong thing out of those questions. Are they questions that have been asked before? Have they been asked in a similar way? Sure, but maybe not in this climate and certainly not with this character, and that's what makes it different. Without going too deep into my own theories, the biggest thing I got out of it is ""help people"". There were so many points where this slow-motion car crash could have been stopped, but it didn't. Another thing is, how much are other people to blame? These are interesting questions, and what makes it more interesting is knowing this character and where he ends up. As to the violence, none of the violence is particularly over the top in a Deadpool or Michael Bay sort of way, but that's sort of what makes it more uncomfortable. It's grounded and unnerving. It's also very Joker-ish, with some scenes that are weirdly playful in a bizarre way where you don't really know what he's going to do. This was a unique direction to take this character, and Joaquin Phoenix kills it as Arthur/Joker with a empathic psychopath. It's a thoughtful but uncomfortable feel-bad sort of movie I'm still thinking about and really want to talk about. I don't get that sort of movie often enough.",Michael M,5

20-Jan-20,"Maybe if 4 and 5 stars didn't involve recommending the movie, I'd give Joker a higher rating here. Also, the movie is pretty dark. The reason I stuck with the 3 out of 5 star rating is because the movie is too dark for my taste and not really a movie I'd recommend because of that reason. Don't get me wrong, Phoenix did a fine job in his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. He became the character and the storytelling and the way it was presented made you empathize with Arthur even if he turned out to be a killer. It's great acting and for what it's meant to be, it's a solid film. I just think it's a little too dark for my liking, but to each his own.",Gilberto T,3

19-Jan-20,"Great acting-- excellent commitment by its star (Phoenix deserves all of the nominations and any awards he should win), but the story is just awful. This is the man (Joker) who menaces Batman and keeps him up at night? Christopher Nolan's version of Joker with Heath Ledger nailed it. The script in this version feels like it was written without much thought to the canon or the fans.",John T,2

19-Jan-20,"As billed, it is a great performance by Phoenix and a good character movie. Does a nice job of making the emergence of the Joker believable. It is hard to say it is an enjoyable movie, however, because most of it is intense and sets out to make viewer a little uncomfortable... and culminates in a dark, intense ending. Not sure how many specifics I will remember, but cannot deny it was well done.",Randy A,3.5

19-Jan-20,It's an ok movie doesn't really feel like a joker film more like a crazy who wanted to be like the joker. Could have down some much with the Joker character you have a vilians who's primary purpose was to mess with one guy who happens to be a billionaire detective and most of the time it works atleast partially. Imagine the planning it would take for someone to pull off a heist like he did in the second dark night movie I would have like to see more off that joker not some guy dancing around mad at the world. And SPOILER. Why was it necessary to insert the Wayne's into to this mess so you not only destory the backstory of one character but also start treading on another. This was an uninspired take on the jokers origin.,Willie S,1
19-Jan-20,I'm glad I never made it to the theater to see this film but I think it's decent for DVD I think Arthur is poor sole due to snap I think when he found out the truth bout his mother that was straw that broke the camel back,,3
19-Jan-20,"Amazing!!!!! Since there is no real back story to The Joker, and DC has always had multiple versions of how he came to be, this is by far the best. If you're looking for the Saturday morning cartoon version, don't bother. If you want a gritty, no frill Dark Knight type back story, this movie is a must see.",David R,5

19-Jan-20,"This is the best film I've seen in years. It's impeccably made and perfectly acted by Phoenix. I saw one review on another site that gave it one star because it was so profoundly sad. Other negative reviews echo this. People, there are humans out there that lead tragic lives, whose stories are heartbteakingly unfair. If ""Joker"" succeeds in making you uncomfortable with this, then it has done its job. I recently watched ""Manhunt: Unabomber,"" and Kozinsky's final letter to his brother is something Joker could have written. These people walk among us, and looking away from them and their stories is what ultimately causes the carnage they create. This is a tragic story, exquisitely told. If you want a feel good movie, then don't deem this bad because it makes you feel blue. In that case, go watch a Disney flick. This is stunning filmmaking.",Mary A,5

18-Jan-20,"It was very well produced and a great story, however there were stretches of the film which became very dry and felt tedious to watch. There are many new complexities added when you seek online analyses, but for me it was a negative that these couldn't be picked up on during the sole watching of the film.",Erin B,3
18-Jan-20,"*No spoliers.* I refuse to deny anyone else the knock-back-in-your-seat moment that I got. A few knocks, in honesty. Joker: Gutting. Riveting. Bleak. Triumphant. This film is still sitting in the pit of my stomach and I find myself sifting through and re-analyzing scenes over and over with no let-up in sight. I admit that 15 or 20 minutes into this film I was thinking ""ok, so this is a bit more light and predictable than I'd expected..."" But my god, how naive I was at that point in. Fair warning: be prepared to be sucker-punched when you think you're coasting along just fine with this story. Out of nowhere, you are going to get belted in the head with what you didn't even expect was coming. And then again. And then, when you have accepted that this movie throws twists at you as a matter of course and you're semi-flinching at each new scene change, prepare to be kicked in the gut with a revelation that will floor you in the endless defeat that is Arthur Fleck's pitiful life. I can't remember when a scene so thoroughly broke me in a movie. If you can't deal with being knocked down hard and left to flounder, utterly empty, as the story continues to build rapidly in front of you despite you still struggling to find the will to scramble back up onto your feet and catch up, then skip this film. Go watch Hustlers or some other polite, typical Hollywood fare. It's a sign of a profoundly poignant story and a very literal masterpiece of acting when you stagger away from a movie and find you are genuinely grieving for a fictional character. Where to start with something of this magnitude? Joachin's performance is so real it is painful to watch in many scenes. The transition, in 122 minutes of screen time, from beaten, defeated, humiliated, curled up in a ball on the ground in a dirty alley Arthur Fleck to confident, powerful, remorselessly violent, triumphantly beholding the havoc he has wrought Joker is absolutely seamless. At no point in the movie did I notice a jarring or unnatural jump-- his metamorphosis was as smooth as his entirely interpretive dance moves as he came into his own. 122 minutes. I wouldn't have thought it could be done. The flawless direction, the cinematography (how many times during this movie did it hit me that the scene could be a perfect still in and of itself?), the score (that gorgeous, haunting, defeating, exultant SCORE!), the attention to period detail in every single aspect... the surprises, the awkwardness that makes you itch and desperately need that scene to be over with, the unexpected laugh out loud moments that just as quickly sadden you in their implications.... the endearing main character you witness dying, leaving you to come to terms every minute along the way with him as your brain processes how you view him... ""Joker 'Surprises' With 11 Oscar Nominations""-- only to those who didn't watch it, or to those whose vapid inner workings prevented them from access into its dark, gritty genius, or whose delicate sensitivities shielded them from seeing its brutal, malignant offerings. Hard to watch? Yes. Not for everyone? Oh, most definitely. If you're not sure you could handle this movie, you can't. Even if you do think you can, maybe you can't. I don't know how well I handled it myself. But Jesus, was the ride ever worth it. And if you haven't seen it yet, I implore you not to read reviews by The Guardian or The New Yorker. The fact they pan it is inconsequential. However, the fact that 3 of their reviewers were too shallow to notice a huge, integral part of the plot, which led to them actually announcing a game-changing spoiler, is not. That cherished, cinematic sucker-punch is what I'd pay money for every time. Don't let people with limited understanding of the exact depth of emptiness in our hero's existence ruin that ride for you. Because my god, what a ride it is.",Sue T,5

18-Jan-20,"My favorite movie of 2019 and the best DCU movie since The Dark Knight. It's raw, gritty, and unflinching in its delivery. It's like the DCU version of Logan. I'd love to see a sequel which connects it to the broader super hero world. It's not really a comic book movie, at least not in the formulaic, no consequences, overly-CGI sense. However, it is one of my favorite origin stories. It's a wonderful character exposition, told entirely from the perspective of Arthur Fleck. The vibe is similar to Fight Club, in that you can't really trust this first-person perspective. If you haven't seen it in theaters, add it to your queue.",Jeremy S,5

So I am fine seeing this as a stand alone film that did not necessarily have to adhere to the Batman storyline. That said, I found this film to be one that was gritty, tragic and interesting storytelling. Although I was shocked to read so many Negative reviews from critics, whose commentary I would normally be interested in, but I found really far off the mark about the film and Phoenix. He gave a seriously interesting performance and I'm not even normally a fan. I did find so many references to TAXI DRIVER and that was definitely for me the same type of character....starting out circling The rim and ending up going down. For me it was not overly acted; too socially alienating or even too violent. Especially given regular television viewing. And maybe some of these Folks just don't see enough marginalized humans on which such a character could be based.",Gayle C,4

Phoenix did what he does best, very deep method acting. His madness was so convincing that you can't help but feel for the Joker.

Witnessing such mental deterioration in Joaquin's character will fill you with an aching sense of dread. I truly loved this movie; it's definitely worth more than one watch.",Kylie K,5
17-Jan-20,"Let's start by saying that I did enjoy the movie. It's a good film, entertaining. But the hype made me expect more and that just wasn't there. I'm not in agreement with Dan Kois at Slate who dismisses the movie as ""stupid"". There are moments that stretch the line of credulity, but no more so than any other superhero film. My complaints about the movie center on two main things; plot development and character veracity. As to plot, the movie creates a sense of impending doom without ever delivering on the doom. Knowing that the character would eventually become the mass-murdering ""Clown Prince of Crime"" is supposed to infuse all of the main character's actions with import. What the movie doesn't do is build to an inevitable crescendo that resolves itself in tragedy. In this way the movie is less horrific than it ought to be. Horror is best when the end product is the result of one action or choice after another - building to an inevitable conclusion. But in ""Joker"" there is no inevitability, no lie the character believes, no inciting moment, no complication and development, no buildup of tension leading to an inevitable peak. Act I is the same as Act II which is the same as Act III in this movie b/c there really is no progress, or attempt to avoid the inevitable, or gradual discovery of the awfulness, or repetition of symbolic metaphors. There is one big mother of a temper tantrum on live tv which results in some redecorating of the walls of the set but there is no real climax to the story. In terms of plot, therefore, it's more like watching snow fall off a roof or watching paint dry or watching a pancake slide down a wall; you know it will and when it does... meh. In terms of character I have two main disagreements. First is an implausibility to the Arthur Fleck character - the guy is a total sad sack whose eventual ""transformation"" into the Joker is more like one more sucky thing happening to him than it is a moment of horrific inevitability. It is hard to accept that one person would have so many bad things happen to him; abusive adoptive mother, crappy apartment, loser talents, dead end job, miserable gritty town, hostile and antagonistic neighbors, lousy boss, health issues, bad looks - yeah, your life sucks, dude. But oddly, even when people seem to have lousy lives they still have humor, friends, moments of joy, insight, access to art or poetry or song or booze - which make life bearable. Why didn't Fleck have any of this? Alright, so he's a loser with the ladies, but couldn't he have made a pass at that cute social worker, or maybe struck up a conversation with the gal on the subway after he killed those three dudes? or learned to play the guitar on the street like John Lee Hooker? or get drunk at the local with other losers? Something! Anything! It's as though the writers didn't know what normal humans actually do with their run-down lives. Normal humans eat junk food and get diabetes; binge watch ""Game of Thrones"" on Netflix; play pool or checkers or Pacman at the local arcade - Something! Anything! besides washing their Grendelian mother every night. The character just seems unbelievable. Indeed, against a hostile world human beings have a startling resilience which takes the most amazing forms; learning to polka dance at the Czech club - collecting spores, molds and fungus - becoming the leading expert on ""Doc Savage"" comics. Something! Anything! Resistance is not futile! Second, Aristotle had it right when he said that horror or tragedy in a character is always strongest when it is the result of the character's own choices & actions. To choose evil, or even to choose without understanding and thus make a fatal mistake leading to inevitable ruin, is more horrible than simply being the patsy for a violent world. In ""Joker"" the maniac is created by a hostile world abusing a poor demented victim. Arthur Fleck even says this when talking to Murray Franklin (DeNiro) What do you get...when you cross...a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you ******' deserve! This is too simplistic an equation, I think. It is as if to say that ""society"" is to blame � rather than individuals who are evil or good. Fleck is just ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore!"" More to the point is that in terms of art the character is not so horrific because he never CHOOSES to be a monster. The truly horrific human monsters in literature and in life such as Grendel, Macbeth, Patrick Bateman, Niander Wallace, or John Gacey, Jeffrey Dahmer, Pol Pot, Che Guevara � all choose the role of monster. Perhaps they justify their actions or perhaps they had horrible things done to them, but their choice remained their own. The Swansea conference, or the treatments of the kulaks by Stalin, or the flaying of young coeds, or Idi Amin's cannibalistic devouring of his enemies, abuse, child-molestation, random school shootings, sl�t unwearnum / b�t b�nlocan / bl�d �drum dranc / synsna�dum swealh � these are the horrific monsters of human society and all are the result of choice, not mere accident. As an audience we do not find horror only in the violence they perpetrate but in the CHOICE to commit such violence. Our horror stems from the knowledge that perhaps we too might make a similar choice. It would not be so pungent were these events mere accidents of nature, or if they were perpetrated by some unthinking beast. It is, rather, the willed malice that causes horror to rise in us like some cold Lovecraftian behemoth. But Fleck's simpering victimhood doesn't inspire such horror. He is a pitiable character with his expressions of ""I just hope my death make more cents than my life"" (poor blighter can't even spell right) and his Hitchcockian mother complex (""She always tells me to smile, and put on a happy face"" = pathetic) but he is a victim � a sad skinny puppy cowering in the rain. Even his name is little more than a fleck even though he is supposed to be Arthurian in his greatness. When he kills his victims there is even an invitation to rejoice as each one is a bully, a jerk, an abuser deserving of some justice. In the final murder of Murray Franklin (in an obvious homage to the Frank Miller scene) I had to stifle a little cheer as it seemed so appropriate. More horror exists in seeing Oedipus come out on stage with his bleeding eyeballs, or watching Sweeney Todd (Len Cariou) suddenly discover who the beggar woman is whom he has just murdered, or watching Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) drive his son over the cliff with the cattle. When Fleck has his final apotheosis on the police car amidst cheering crowds of clown-masked adorers there is little to cheer or be horrified by � it's just� meh. In conclusion, I would recommend this movie. It is a worthy addition to the Batman lore. Certainly Joaquin Phoenix gives a performance which, though never building in intensity, definitely is deserving of consideration. The music and camera work are both quite good and there is something of merit in seeing what the movie has to say. But overall, were I to choose it again, I might enjoy watching pancakes slide down the wall instead.",William L,3.5

17-Jan-20,The jocker movie goes up and beyond in many aspects with the soundtrack able to switch to a sad and scary theme than to a loud and classical theme with great performances and being one of the first movies to actually get shocked and fearful towards Arthur fleck. With some downsides being that it copies other movies beat for beat like the king of comedy is a big comparison other than that a good movie.,Maverick K,4
17-Jan-20,"I think the best Joker is the Killing Joke (comic) version, however this is a good adaptation and modernization of the Joker. One of fundamental problems I have with this film is that they are making the Joker more of an anti-hero instead of a full villain. Yeah it's important to be have a human background, but I want to see himself killing innocent people not just people who offended Joker feelings. The best Joker comes from the Killing Joke knows that life is a joke, and that anyone who goes through that ""1 bad day"" will become crazy like the Joker and the Batman... and that life is completely pointless... so it doesn't matter who dies or not, because all life is a joke to him. I think Batman part of the story was really weak, which is also a disappointment because Joker in a weird love relationship with the Batman in this books, so it's disappoint they Batman didn't push the ""Joker"" in the acid pit, and that Joker isn't obsessive with the Batman.... I hope if they do a sequel to this Joker movie, they had all the above element stories to the Joker, and they lose the ""anti-hero"" touch or else they screw up the character like they did to our beloved Vemon in the comic books. Where Vemon was a full on villain, and slowly though the years, they turned him into a ""greyish type of hero""...sometimes doing the bad thing, but usually working with regular superheroes like ""it no problem"". Carnage was actually made because of Vemon changing into a hero, and Carnage was also based on the old version Vemon and Joker.",Andrew S,3
17-Jan-20,"Should have been called, �Not the Joker.� Great acting by the main character but then, he�s often the same deranged, misanthrope in his movies. Stick with the comic book formula. It works. Go changing things up for �artistic license?� Sure, you�ll get awards but this isn�t The Joker.",,2.5

17-Jan-20,"SPOILER WARNING! Pros: I like how the villain is the protagonist and instead of hating him you feel bad for him. You feel bad for Joker right away when he is just holding up a sign and gets jumped and the sign was destroyed. You feel even more bad for him when he gets fired by his boss because he gets blamed for breaking a sign. So Randal buys a gun but this gun is very important to the movie and I like it. The thing I like even more about this movie is that you see Joker as a good guy at the start of the movie but by the end of it he is a villain. So he has a dream where he is on a tv show and he is on Murray's tv show. So in a bar Arthur makes some jokes that nobody laughs at so later in the movie Murray makes fun of him. So he meets a girl but so you thought he met this girl because this girl was all in his head. So when Arthur(Joker) gets a second job as a clown for a children's hospital he brings a gun but it falls out f his coat so he gets fired and you continue to feel bad for him. So when he is on the bus he is laughing because of a condition he has that makes him laugh randomly and he does. So the three guys on the bus make fun of him and start to beat him up the same way those kids beat him at the start of the movie. So he shoots his gun and kills one of them but instead of making him unlikable you feel bad for him and root for him. So you want Arthur to kill those three guys and he does and it is used eventually to start a movement. Eventually, Thomas Wayne is crying about their deaths on tv. The movie picks up when you realize the girlfriend was all in his imagination and his dad could be Thomas Wayne. I like the scene where Arthur visits the Wayne mansion and talk to Bruce Wayne. I also really like the part where Thomas Wayne and Arthur are in the bathroom and Thomas Wayne is mad because Joker touch Bruce's cheeks so he punches Arthur and you feel bad for him. When you figure out all the lies Arthur's mom told him that's when you feel really bad for him because his mother said that the condition that makes him laugh is made up. So Arthur kills his mom but you still don't hate him. After he puts on makeup and gets a costume and becomes Joker and that is when I got really excited. When David and Randal go to Arthur's house to check on him he killed Randal. So, later on, He dances down a staircase and you like it and can get into his vibe. So he is getting chased by cops but he gets a mask. So he eventually meets Murray and he gets to be on a tv show but he wants to be introduced as Joker. When he is on tv it is incredible. I won't go into too much detail but he makes some good pointers on how he thinks society is wrong and in a way you can see where he is coming from and in a way you can see how his actions are wrong. So he kills Murray and gets arrested but his movement has start and one of the people inspired by this movement kills Thomas and Martha Wayne. So Joker gets arrested and has me thinking that there could be a sequel and I really hope they make a sequel. The great thing about this movie is that the more you think about it the better it gets and the more you like it. Cons: The movie is very similar to Taxi Driver and you could make this exact movie about a different character and it would still feel the same because this movie doesn't really feel like a Joker movie. Overall I am really happy that Joaquin Pheonix won an Oscar from this movie and I think he 100% deserves it. I'm gonna give Joker an (A)",Matt F,4.5
17-Jan-20,"Watched The Joker last night and what a crazy trippy ride it was, to be expected of course! Joaquin Phoenix is ""The Joker"" I'm convinced! He played the role so perfectly it's as if I didn't even see Joaquin Phoenix, I saw the Joker! It took me so long to fall asleep after watching, it was brutal and heart wrenching but at the same time I couldn't get over the cinematography and how this tragic film could be made so beautifully! Every scene was a piece of art, carefully framed to perfection which was contrast to Jokers erratic behavior but so well balanced, the lighting, placement, positioning, timing etc, the music fit the emotions I felt throughout. I haven't seen a film I could barely watch yet love at the same time for it's all around brilliance! I feel messed up, touched and inspired all at once!",Patricia O,4.5

16-Jan-20,"Joker is one of those rare movies that is able to bring together both traditional movie lover and the new superhero genre that now floods the cinemas. It a film that perfectly captivated the Joker in a new, but also inspired by the comics he was based on. The movie it's self though is amazing at capturing the feeling of Gotham and gave it this disgusting and miserable place that can turn anyway crazy. Also the score is amazingly haunting and perfect at depicting the feeling Authur has towards Gotham and the people of Gotham as a whole. And of course, Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the joker was just superb and without a dought Oscar worthy.

16-Jan-20,"I don't know whether I'm crazy or not but certainly for me, Joker played the role of a hero in this movie, not a mental person who enjoys killing others. Yes, he was a heroic symbol against the corruption prevalent in Gotham city, a city filled with culprits wearing suits who pretend to be nice. A city which made the Joker out of itself. Joker was symbol of a naive and innocent person who can turn into an evil monster by people's sarcasm and badwill although many would see the Evil part of this character. To be fair, the story of Batman and Joker is extremely complex, inquisitiveness raising and appealing for me, more than any other heroic movie such as ... (let's not be movist). This story is a portrayal of two heroes of whom one is following the human way and the other following the bad way because he is obliged to!",ali s,5

16-Jan-20,"Pump your brakes. This is not going to be the kind of hyperbolic, eccentric, best-movie-in-a-decade Joker reviews that you are accustomed to seeing across social media. You will see that I think this is an excellent film, but I don't see it going down as a generation-defining one. Before we learn much about our protagonist and our plot, we are immersed in the gritty, hard-hitting setting. The streets of Gotham are lined with garbage bags, vandalism, homeless, shattered glass, and the like. All of these eloquently add to the haunting, cold atmosphere of the time and place, and aid the audience in understanding why the citizens are drawn to the choices they make, and perhaps even empathize with them (production design by Mark Freidberg). Also worth commending is the outstanding cinematography by Lawrence Sher, which almost literally places the audience in the world and in the moment right alongside the characters. (Maybe this was just me, but I seemed to notice that the lighting flashes on the infamous subway scene all occurred on the beat changes and mood shifts. If true, a genius choice). I could write a book on Joaquin Phoenix. Granted, his performance is another aspect of the movie where I'm not ranting and raving as extremely as the rest of the masses. I actually thought the production design was a stronger element of the film, hence why I started with it. However, it would still border on journalistic malpractice to not acknowledge the jaw-drop inducing talent that Phoenix displayed. With a character like this, some amateur actors could easily fall in the trap of ""playing a crazy person"". With Phoenix, I didn't see a crazy person on screen for a single frame. I saw a disadvantaged, neglected human being who is desperately seeking validation and love, as we all are. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the performance is the stark contrast between Arthur and Joker. When Arthur ""takes off the mask"" (or, in this case, puts on the makeup), he transforms from the awkward, ungainly introvert to the cool, self-assured anarchist, releasing and embracing the darkness that lives below the surface. It was almost like watching two different characters. Phoenix delivers a performance for the ages, and more than earns his seat next to Nicholson and Ledger at the table of comic book film royalty. Finally, I have to address the score of this film. Ho. Ly. Cow. Haunting, unsettling, frightening, you name it. I have never heard a piece of film music that puts the audience directly into a character's head like this one does. Hildur Gu�nad�ttir's work on this movie is seen by many as a game changer, and I totally agree. I can see it ending up as a standard for film composers in the years to come, and it would be well deserved. Joker transcends the comic book genre, and it is a technical marvel that is truly an encyclopedia of filmmaking. 9/10.",Brad H,4.5

15-Jan-20,"Truly one of the must-watch movies of the 2010s. Touches on some very sensitive and modern issues, such as depression, mental illness and the aversion society has to taking them seriously. This critique could explain the negative reviews. I never watch superhero (aka capsh*t) movies, but this is a dark, gritty character study which happens to be about a comic book villain. The character carries us through the story, and so do the locations and challenges he has to face. The movie's aesthetic is clearly influenced by other great movies of the pre-2000s such as Taxi Driver and Fight Club. I'm serious when I say the story touched my heart and soul. Never have I felt so much sadness and compassion for a comic book villain. Very easy to relate to, a fluid plot which can be perceived differently by different people. Big media hates it possibly because they see their own flaws in it. Overall: GO SEE IT!",Antoan G,5

15-Jan-20,"""Joker"" is a well-made movie, with a performance by Joaquin Phoenix that is riveting and terrifying, but in the end is without purpose or meaning. The movie wants to be, I suppose, about a personal descent into madness as a metaphor for society's descent into madness. But it treats neither the person nor the society as anything but props for the scenes that unfold before us--scenes without meaning, context, or purpose, other than to disturb us and make us feel deeply uncomfortable. The movies succeeds at that, but at little else. Consider Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Does he come across as insane? He certainly does. Is he frightening in his madness? Yes, without question. Do I find myself noticing his acting during the movie? Unavoidably, yes, and that's not a good thing. It's not Phoenix's fault. He's acting the hell out of the part. The problem is, there is nothing else to notice in the movie except for Phoenix. I guess it's a great performance, if by that we mean a performance that fills the screen. But the camera did half the work in that regard. The problem is that we gain no insights into his character and his madness, and we gain no insights into why his madness spreads like a virus into society. Or maybe society's madness seeps into him. The movie doesn't seem to care. We don't learn why society is in such a fragile state. We don't learn why the people who take to the streets do so. We are supposed to simply accept it all. In fact, the movie is nearly devoid of any contact with the rest of the world, unless you count one stone-faced bureaucrat and a few cast-offs who populate a ""clown agency,"" of which there is probably no such thing. The movie might as well take place entirely in Arthur Fleck's bedroom, and practically does. In refusing to confront or deal with the societal issues it raises, the movie leaves us empty and helpless in the face of sheer horror. In the end, ""Joker"" is a preening display of pointless violence, without meaning or hope. Perhaps that was the goal of director Todd Phillips and screenwriter Scott Silver. If so, ""Joker"" is a movie that didn't need to be made.",Steve W,2

I was nervous about this movie. As a lifelong comic fan, and Joker fan, I wasn't sure about this approach. I didn't like that it wasn't part of a larger DC Universe. Once the movie began I didn't care. After watching it I don't think I want a larger DC Universe incorporated with this character. This is NOT a fun,popcorn Marvel movie. It's not an over the top bombastic Extended DC Universe movie. It's an amazing character study that addresses mental health issues that we do often ignore until it jumps up and bites us.

There was no dive into Joker's emotions, no real time to sit with him, for us to fully grasp his feelings. It all left me frustrated. The 'descent' was merely a stroll, and the people leading him to it bore seemingly no weight. Things happened to him, he did things as a reaction, the A to B journey is there, but the 'why' and meat of the story has just been forgotten. It was like a calendar of events. The laughing also massively drains the complexity of the character. Because of it, there's no layers for us to explore, as it's the only emotion that the movie shows us.",Audrey M,2.5

I felt sympathy for the main actor, was he the hero in the movie ? My feeling are confused now. Viewing the Joker emerge from Arthur's sheepish persona was extraordinary. I felt a guilt in celebration of his first act of difiance. A concern first time for his well being. I clearly have never connected with THE JOKER as I know him better now. For my appreciation I am sure he will have a Knock Knock Joke to tell.",Shiraz K,5

14-Jan-20,"Joker gives us a solid story that despite having already been told, works within its context. And that together with a phenomenal interpretation of Joaquin Phoenix, create a quite enjoyable movie. The movie is good, but honestly I think it is somewhat overrated. Although not many like that word. But, hey... THAT'S LIFE.",Diego G,3.5
14-Jan-20,"I have never seen a superhero movie or any movie based on a comic book. They don't interest me. I am not a fan of Action or Fantasy films. I do a website about Andy Warhol's films. Joker is a great film. It realistically portrays the tragedy of people who are born with the cards stacked against them. It is more ""Come Back Little Sheba"" than ""Batman."" The dialogue is brilliant and Joaquin deserves every award he gets. This film is so good it is almost outside the realm of ""Hollywood"" films - certainly more experimental and ""avant-garde"" than Tarantino's over-rated middle-of-the-road comedy.",Gary C,5

13-Jan-20,"Mind opening takes on modern society and mental illness from the eyes of the deranged. Phoenix shines like a diamond as the arch-nemesis of ""the caped crusader"" in what is essentially a prequel to the carnage of what is to come to future ""Gotham City"". One of the best films of 2019 and easily the best of the superhero film sub-genre.",Kevin M,3.5
13-Jan-20,Very Very disappointed in Joker. It was a depressing waste of 5.99 on Prime. It does not belong in the DC universe.,Kenneth F,1
13-Jan-20,"Todd Phillips' adaptation of the Clown Prince of Crime is a masterpiece � it's a perfect marriage of directorial brilliance and flawless, albeit somewhat excessive, acting. The combination of which resulted in a version very different from Nolan's interpretation of Batman's archenemy. This Joker is more unpredictable, chaotic and altogether absurd. While the former displays a certain level of intelligence, Joaquin Phoenix's interpretation is pure volatility. Joker's most interesting achievement, however, is how it successfully captures the ironic nature of the character; painting him as a depressingly unamusing enigma with no rhyme or reason behind his behavior.",Caleb R,5
13-Jan-20,"Exquisite performance by Joaquin Phoenix in his role as Arthur Fleck, He felt genuinely sucked into every part that he was in, it really felt as if he was thoroughly enjoying his role. The directing skills by Todd Phillips were absolutely perfect",Dacoda&96 C,5
13-Jan-20,"Within the levels of horror, Joker succeeds on so many levels. A little dark for me at times, but that is of course what the character of Joker is supposed to reflect. AMAZING job from Phoenix. Just beautiful acting. The viewer seems to understand the unfortunate happenings of why Joker is Joker, which I never thought I would do.",Magnus A,4
13-Jan-20,Great movie! The Joker is a must see,jonathon C,5
13-Jan-20,"I wanted so to like this. Big Joker fan. I think he did a good acting job. However, the storyline was jumbled. Some of it made sense, other parts felt like they were thrown in just to fill movie time. I get the mental health issue president, but it's also was far off the deep edge. The biggest part that did not fit was the neighbor and her daughter??? Sorry, if a weird guy followed me to my daughters school, I won't discuss it with him or invite him in my apartment, I would just call the police on him. It was like the writer felt he had to add a love interest or sex scene to complete the movie. It didn't belong. The big question Was this version of Joker better the Health Ledger? No. It was too over the top, to over exaggerated. He did a good job, but I think he was trying way too hard, it wasn't as smooth as Ledger. I can't put my finger on it - but something was missing from the character. It's a good rainy day movie if you like dark edge movies.",Judy S,3

13-Jan-20,"Unique, daring, gritty and emotional Joker knocks it out the park with perfect directing, impeccable cinematography and dazzling screenwriting that all contribute to an unforgettable story.

13-Jan-20,"In a Hollywood landscape dominated by blockbuster superhero films with flashy CGI and classic good vs. evil storytelling, Joker is a refreshing escape into a far more serious side of the comic book movie genre. Joaquin Phoenix gives what is, in my opinion if not his best, certainly his most transformed and embodied performance of his career and I think the best performance from a lead actor all year. Todd Phillips shows his ability to branch out from the world of comedy into the dark, gritty mind of a super villain. I do think there is one problem with this film so I will be getting into a spoiler if you have not seen the film yet. *SPOILERS AHEAD* In my view, the Wayne's deaths feel out of place. I think the scene does not occur organically and feels as though it was thrown in as an afterthought. Joker is, in my opinion one of the top three films of the year along with Marriage Story and The Irishman, all of which could be selected for best picture at the oscars with my full support.",Ryan A,5
13-Jan-20,"Cinematography was awesome, colors and lighting takes you right back to the 70s-80s. When DC decides to do these one-off dark movies, it's kisk-ass, targeting adults rather than kids.",Humpity D,4.5

13-Jan-20,One of the greatest films i've seen in a long time. Really gets inside your head and blurs the line between good and bad in this character. Joaquin Pheonix is amazing and really shows of his incredible talent. 10/10 a must see not only for comic book fans but movie goers in general.,Ross W,5
13-Jan-20,Dark and depressing  leaves you without hope. Sets up a clash between the rich who think they deserve to be rich because they earned it and the destitute who think their condition is caused by the rich and entitled. I hope it's not a prognostication.,Bob K,3.5

13-Jan-20,One of the best movies of our time,Alia A,5
13-Jan-20,"Average at best. After all of the hype and drama surrounding the movie you think it would live up to it - it didn't. The character is inconsistent, acting is just average, and as a Joker origin story it is terrible. There is no way this character can be a future Joker and rival Batman. He's not smart and not charismatic enough. Regarding the violence, not bad at all and the incel stuff is non-existent. Let's be honest, while we love to hate Jared Leto's Joker, it is actually pretty comic accurate - Leto and the character just didn't get a fair shake in the movie.",John M,2.5
13-Jan-20,"This Movie is absolutely gorgeous. Almost all scenes are just stunning and beautifully shot and on that token alone it is worth the watch. This is indeed a disturbing movie, but in my opinion cinema should encourage emotion, whether it be positive or negative it doesn't matter. Just as long as it makes you feel something. Acting is phenomenal, staging is perfect. Just a fantastic, interesting creation. It still has me messed up and i watched it two days ago.",Marco F,5
13-Jan-20,"This film is an absolute masterpiece! From the writing, to the directing, to the cinematography. But what really stands out is Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the titular character, Arthur Fleck/The Joker. He gives the role 110%, doing an excellent job of portraying Arthur's descent into insanity after being mistreated by society one too many times.",Jackson O,5
13-Jan-20,"It is a solid movie. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an above par method take on Arthur Fleck. In general, it is a movie that I'll see once recommend it to others but probably not watch it again for a while. The homage to Taxi Driver is a little too on point sometimes. This was a movie that was given a very small budget and was a one-off. I hope there is a sequel and would be interested to see WB do a series of ""realistic"" superhero movies.",Robert B,3.5
13-Jan-20,"Like King Of Comedy meets Taxi Driver. Nice to see DC back in true form. For a while it seemed like DC was trying in vain to cash in on Marvel's success with Batfleck and Co in Spandex playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with their respective super powers. Glad to see them return to the dark, brooding and psychological aspects that make Batman's universe so great.",Ben C,3.5
13-Jan-20,"A bit slow to start, and there are some jarring moments with the tone it's going for, but this is still a great film. It's mostly carried by Joaquin Phoenix himself I think, he really understands the character and brings all he has to bring a very different kind of Joker to life. He's not really comparable with Heath Ledger, they are too different.",Clara H,4
13-Jan-20,This was great origin story for an even greater villain. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix show how a innocent beaten man can become the most notorious criminal in all of Gotham.,Harry M,4.5
13-Jan-20,"Honestly this movie got a lot of flack from the media before anyone even saw it which made critics jump the gun which is why the score is so low, this movie is great from the cinematography, to the fantastic performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Is it a perfect movie? No but i personally think its damn near close",Joseph C,4.5
13-Jan-20,An amazing portrayal of society. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is masterful.,cassandra f,5
13-Jan-20,"So... When I first saw this movie I wanted to give it five stars. Then I saw it again, and my rating changed to four stars. Then I saw ""The King Of Comedy"" and now my rating is 3 stars. Then I saw ""Taxi Driver"" and it changed to 3 stars. and now I hate this movie. I mean this isn't an homage to Scoresese, this is stealing Scoresese. Arthur Fleck is legit just Rupert Pupkin, they even sound similar. Another thing is this movie is so gosh dang long and SLOW. The second time I watched this it was a chore. Also I HATE that this isn't a comic book movie and I'm actually really offended that it is classified as the ""Best"" comic book movie, mainly because this isn't even based on a comic book. Yeah I guess some elements of joker stories are in here but like, Arthur Fleck isn't the joker and he never will be. This movie isn't original, it's two different better movies plotlines mixed together with a clown. .5/10 just as bad as Venom.",Macauly L,0.5
13-Jan-20,"The new Joker is so upsetting and realistically violent that I almost couldn't finish watching it. It's also incredibly well acted. That being said, if you identify with Joaquin Phoenix's character as a relatable anti-hero you need to get the fuck away from me. Can we stop making movies that glorify violent incels. Violence can be used to make a valid point. This iteration of the joker was gratuitous and gross.",Meredith B,0.5

13-Jan-20,It wasn't as good as I was expecting. If they would have used the joker from the suicide squad and possibly introduced Harley Quinn ( even if it would have been during the credits to lead up to a part 2) it would have been better. I'm so glad I didn't go to the theater. If they make a sequel I won't watch it in a theater. I will wait for it to be on redbox. That way I'm only out $1.80.,Chad F,2
13-Jan-20,"This was certainly an entertaining movie. Shot very nicely. Acting was very good. Told a good story behind the scenes. I just don't think it fit the Gotham/Batman universe as it was told. The Joker would be an old man by the time Bruce grew up to be Batman. Everyone including the police would know who the Joker was before he became the iconic villain. Just felt like it was using the DC universe as a prop to gain interest in the movie to me. Was good, but a movie that just didn't need to be made.",Harry M,3.5

This movie with a thin plot and seemed to be about nothing but mental illness, vigilantism and gratuitous violence??? Joachim and De Niro are always talking about social injustice, taking up liberal platforms- so why THIS movie? Why not something that sends the right message? High School kids are watching this and thinking it's so ""cool"" the Joker got revenge on those that bullied him - but is it? Is it cool what he did? Hollywood is getting it WRONG while they preach for better gun laws at their awards ceremonies. Talk about who the real Jokers are.......",D P,0.5

12-Jan-20,"This movie got so much buzz that I almost went to theater to watch. Glad I didn't. A somber dreary story about a mental patient with a troubled past forced of his meds by chance and turning homicidal. The pace of the movie and boring story line makes it hard to sit thru. Sure, if your into agonized and plagued people spiraling down into a darker place of depression and self loathing you'l have your fill, but for me it made for a lousy movie. Phoenix turns the joker into an awkward and unlikable character that is almost impossible to empathize with and that in return makes it impossible to get into the movie. Joaquine Phoenix's acting has received much praise and he does pull off a convincing psychopath but the weak movie around him and the dull story line kind off take the shine of his performance. The references to batman are served as an afterthought and a side dish, it maybe could have been weaved into a more intriguing movie tapestry. One thing is for sure, I""l never watch this movie again and frankly I would not recommend it either. Unless you crave some depressing and suicidal tendencies for a day. To bad because their probably was potential for a timeless classic, unfortunately not every story told lives up to its potential.",Frank N,2.5
12-Jan-20,A slightly different take on the Joker character. The writers did an excellent job and the possibility of the storyline between Bruce Wayne and Arthur Fleck being the truth is a huge revelation never before told in the DC Universe. This movie stands alone as a classic and doesn't need any kind of comic fan base following to attract audiences.,Steve W,4.5

The acting and characters were phenomenal, the writing is airtight, and it tells a believable and compelling story about a man's descent into madness, with messages and themes about how we need to care about and look after people who are mentally ill or disadvantaged. The shots and cinematography are great, the music score and its use are great. A lot of people are complaining that it makes them feel uncomfortable, but that's kind of the point - it's a look into a disturbing life of a man with a mental illness.",Michael J,5
11-Jan-20,"Todd Phillips directed this box office hit, based on Bob Kane's DC comics character, creating an origin story around Batman's arch nemesis. Set in early 1980s Gotham, overrun by crime where the streets are littered with garbage, a street clown, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), fantasizes about being a stand-up comedian and appearing on television with his favorite talk show host (Robert De Niro). When his dreams fail, he experiences hallucinations which leads to an outbreak of violence that inspires a countercultural revolution against the wealthy Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) in Gotham. This is essentially a Batman movie as if conceived by Scorsese but without the psychological depth or social commentary. Casting De Niro in the movie only makes the comparisons to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" even more obvious. What's most disturbing is that the movie projects an overall feeling of nihilism. Joaquin Phoenix shows, once again, why he is one of the most original and daring of American actors. He takes on one of the most iconic roles and gives it new dimensions. His uncontrollable fits of laughter are indelible. Won Oscars for Best Actor (Joaquin Phoenix) and Original Score. Written by Todd Phillips and Scott Silver. Cinematography is by Lawrence Sher. Music is by Hildur Guonadottir. With Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Shea Whigham, and Bill Camp.",Gregory G,2.5
11-Jan-20,"disturbing, overdone, vague, a torture session to watch. couldn't wait for it to be over. Phoenix is mesmerizing at points, but you have to suffer through a lot of overdone drama, cackling laughing, and the ridiculous notion that everyone punches this guy in the face, to appreciate it...hated it.",Donna H,1.5
11-Jan-20,"The movie was dark and gritty. Joaquin Phoenix played an excellent Joker, one of the best renditions of Joker in any movie and I would love to see a second movie that would tie in with Heath Ledger's portrayal. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars.",John N,5

11-Jan-20,"5/5 stars, perfection.",Christy D,5
11-Jan-20,I really thought that Heath Ledger had spoiled us all and made the iconic role unapproachable for all future actors  I was wrong. Pheonix proved that his previous genius wasn't a fluke and that he was capable of yet another masterful approach to any performance. The filmography as a whole was perfect at always providing a harshly surreal setting that seemed to mirror Aurtur's internal instability. We are at an age where most comic book based cinema is set at a galactic level and where the stakes are so often world ending. The single city setting and Aurthur's personal instability being the central drama were a refreshing change of pace. This movie is the best of 2019 and probably among the best of this past decade.,,5

11-Jan-20,"Romantic portrait of sociopath unravels inventive ideas without overstepping into comic book fare. Although a few cinematic moves borrowed from Nolan's gotham, 'King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', Joker is a solid character piece, which aches and bends into complex expression of the ills of societal neglect. And yes, that stairs scene is iconic.",Shoeless J,3.5
11-Jan-20,Rather different to the mass of superhero films released in recent days. It was quite the performance from Joaquin Phoenix and the story was emotional and represented a fight faced by many people but it was told in a fanciful way. It was just a great film.,Rinu M,4
11-Jan-20,Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as the Joker! Incredible performance!,,3.5
11-Jan-20,"The high point of the movie is obviously the acting of Joaquin Phoenix. This is a deep psychological drama and it's not for everyone. It's slow and the plot is not so elaborated but it's fine because these are features of the genre of which it belongs. The major flaw of this movie is that I found it a complete rip off Taxi Driver by Martin Scorzese. The characters are really similar and they both become accidentally a hero after a crime. The only difference it that the crime in Scorzese's work happens at the epilogue, instead in Joker it's the starting point of the plot. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of differences, but saying that a film which is a clear reinterpretation of another it's the movie of the year i find it far fetched.",Giorgio P,3
11-Jan-20,Phoenix was masterful.,stevejrob L,5
11-Jan-20,"I don't understand the hype. This movie was an absolute mess. Todd Phillips completely butchered the character of the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is so overhyped. The story seems to jump forward randomly without any rhyme or reason. Overall, this was a terrible story that had no business being made. It is an absolute embarrassment that this made over a billion dollars.",Matthew P,0.5

11-Jan-20,"Joker is a okay movie... except for the pacing. I'll explain later. Now there is not a really main villain in this movie. Which sucks but whatever. Characters I hate are Randall, Murray, and Penny. Why because all of them are exactly the same stupid and mean. Things I didn't like about the movie is pacing it takes almost the whole movie for him to actually become the Joker. Another thing for the THIRD freaking TIME why KILL Thomas and his wife. We've seen it THREE TIMES already. The good thing about this movie is how this movie explains Arthur and well the last part of the movie is really GOOD. To some this movie up it's an okay movie I give it a 4 out of 5",Richard R,4
11-Jan-20,The plot is really interesting. Also Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant actor who was perfect for the role. This is one of my favorite movies of all time!,Emma K,5

11-Jan-20,This movie was awful. This movie did not make a lick of sense. It seem to be all over the place. It was very slow and boring. This movie was one of Joaquin Phoenix worse movie ever. Don't waste your time watching this movie,Jennifer R,0.5

10-Jan-20,I love movies a huge movie fan! This movie was terrible!! It was nothing but him laughing crazy every scene. The best part of the movie is pretty much the end. It was borning and I feel that I wasted 20 bucks on Apple TV buying it! Yes I realize that this was the back story of the joker and hey who doesn't love the joker? Come on it's the joker we are talking about! But this isn't the joker we all know. This is a very dark depressed unhappy guy! Who is only happy killing people! If you are waiting for the joker to blow something up or have a bunch of guns with his gang! Don't even waste your time on this movie!! Still the acting was really good! Phoenix did a great job! So did everyone else! But it was a bit to dark for me!,LEna M,0.5
10-Jan-20,"Joker has come a long way since Nicholson. In this dark telling, Phoenix portrays a man and his struggles instead of a comic book character which is actually refreshing. We get to see a personal side of Joker that makes it unique. The storyline and Joker's pain / affliction are unsettling with few gimmicks which makes this movie fantastic.",Abrahm S,4.5
10-Jan-20,"This is the type of movie in which the acting by a single actor is the attraction. The story line wasn't very interesting, it was just enough to move the story along and let Joaquin do his thing. And, yes his acting was really good, but it seemed that what was required for this role wasn't so much about range, as it was about dialing into just the right persona, which he did well. The movie didn't really move me emotionally in any type of way, the entertainment came from finding out where Joaquin would take this character, and he did pretty good.",Diggity H,3
10-Jan-20,I love it! Real and cute,Elizabeth C,5
10-Jan-20,"This is a movie about mental illness, how the world perceives those affected by it and the damage that indifference and intolerance can cause. The acting is flawless and while Phoenix carries the movie on his own shoulders, all those involved deliver top performances. How this movie fits into the DC world and the Batman franchise is irrelevant: this movie is art rather than entertainment.",Alessio F,4.5
10-Jan-20,"It's a movie that helps understand how depression, insecurity and a lack of any social life and the abandonment for someone that clearly needs professional help, drives someone straight to insanity. Interesting enough, the Frank Sinatra's song ""That's life"" displays the difference between a normal person that knows, sometimes bad things are going to happen, but that's fine because as it goes ""I pick myself up and get back in the race"".",Bruno P,5
10-Jan-20,"Absolutely fantastic film. A lot of people have been describing it as disturbing. I think what makes it disturbing is that it makes us question who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. We're used to celebrating when a rich guy in a bat suit beats up the poor and mentally ill, but watching this makes us start to wonder if we are the bad guys. If nothing else, I hope this encourages people to think about the terrible effects of cutting mental health services on society - even though it should certainly be noted that most mentally ill people are more of a danger to themselves than others.",Mark B,4.5

10-Jan-20,Joaquin Pheonix gives one of the best performances of all time as Joker. His performance is completely unique and memorable from any actor. The Film does not just stand on his acting it also has a perfectly crafted storyline and plot that really makes this film GREAT! A+,Ritasya C,5
10-Jan-20,One of the greatest films ever made and make Society take a look in the mirror. And I love the nod to Batman as a kid in the film a lot of critics are giving it bad scores because political BS but don't listen to them Masterpiece of a film,Jose Q,5

10-Jan-20,"The story was implausible. Joaquin's Joker is 45 to Bruce Wayne's 10. How are they going to fight in 20 years? This makes no sense. Plus, the anonymity of who the Joker is is blown by this story. A decent psychological thriller, but not a good origin story for this character.",James V,1.5

10-Jan-20,I dont like it. I'm a normal person that's doesn't read comics. This movie is pretty horrible. I dont care about background or whatever Jack and Heath sold the joker and this movie did not. I felt nothing for him but every other movie had me cheering for the joker. Not this one..,Jonica M,1

09-Jan-20,"Good movie, too bad that the Joker is not in it(Or an accurate Thomas Wayne)",Hernn C,3
09-Jan-20,"Apparently, critics aren't too fond of this movie because of the ""negative influence"" it'll have on people. Hate to break it to you, but movies don't cause others to commit crimes. And besides, this movie is amazing! It's not that original in terms of story or characters, but it's done so well you don't really care. Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job as Arthur Fleck. It's like Heath Ledger's spirit merged with Phoenix's. You feel sorry for him and you're hoping he doesn't turn into the monster Joker is. And Robert De Niro is really great as the show host Murray Franklin. He's pretty charismatic but can be an ass (just like real show hosts). Sometimes, the movie feels almost dreamlike, but there's a reason for that. And each scene just has really good color work. A lot of greens and blues, some yellows and reds. It's a beautiful-looking movie. There is a scene near the end that feels a little forced in but the rest of the movie is very solid. Please watch this movie and don't listen to these fools who say ""it's bad for your brain"" or whatever",Daniel S,4.5

09-Jan-20,"This movie caught my eye at first because of the implementation of mental health, and the effects on the main character. Joker simply had too many loose ends throughout. Too many unrealistic outcomes including the clown symbolism and even the ending scene. The connection between Joker and Batman is very vague and lightly touched.",Jane D,1
09-Jan-20,"I thought the movie was horrible. There was no redeeming value or greater message in it whatsoever unless it was just too emphasize how cold and indifferent our culture can be. That's nothing new. I watch movies to be entertained, not to be horrified. Hollywood has for too long made these kinds of movies. They serve no purpose at all and then they award them. SMH",Ellie F,0.5
09-Jan-20,"Well, this picture made me think about the eternal ... and for a very long time. I did not sleep at night thinking about the Joker and the justice of this valuable and cruel world. Of course - the film is very cool. It should be noted Joaquin's masterful play. The plot of the formation of the Joker is also impeccable. The only questions that arise ... How will he, the loser, broken by fate, become the head of the criminal world of Gotham? Looking at him, I would rather like to say that he will not be able to escape from Arkham ... In any case, the film came out gorgeous. The Phoenix game and musical accompaniment make you close your eyes. 5 out of 5.",Ilya P,5

09-Jan-20,"Magnificent personification of the Joker! Though the movie is supposed to refer to a comic character, we were given real topics such as mental illness, lack of social empathy, poor standards in health care and procedures to prevent danger to self and others when there are mental issues. Whoever feels this movie sets us back with current social issues, is wrong. because we need to address the problems we are facing and a lot of social crime now a days has to do with the unwillingness to talk about what the cause if a problem is. Joaquin Phoenix gave us a more realistic Joker, that can take all his uncared issues to hurt others, and that people, is what we often see in our culture.",Rose,5

09-Jan-20,"Absolutely fresh and real. I loved watching the manner in which Arthur Fleck aka Joker descends into mental instability and a disconnection from humanity through the masterful performance by Joaquin Phoenix. This film is a departure from the former stereotypes of who and what the Joker is and how he came to be. It was almost like watching a film from the Dark Knight Trilogy under Christopher Nolan. It was dark, dramatic, and passionate, but in this case, also very psychotic and cruel. I am and always will be a huge fan of Heath Ledger and his portrayal of the Joker. His was masterful as well as symbolic and it was going to be a very hard sell to replace him as the actor portraying Joker. Joaquin Phoenix pulled it off hands down. This movie incorporates the heart break, the frustration, and the sickness of the mind and soul that would lead to a man who has become free and detached of the constraints and rules of society and how we are expected to live in it. FIVE STARS!!!",Juan N. G,5
09-Jan-20,"It�s good, but not great.",,3
09-Jan-20,"Great acting, cinematography, and passion put into it. I can see it sending a message about how many average outcasts or mentally ill people can feel like. This movie is a character study and is a new change for how some may want the industry to produce.",Manu T,5
09-Jan-20,"I don't know man....I was expecting more. With the two cops in the theatre and all the hype leading up to it. Joaquin's sweet interview on Late Night... I was expecting to be be shot out of a cannon. I'm still waiting for the carnage.... There are 3 scenes of real violence... maybe 4. Phoenix, gets real skinny, makes himself bend funny and prances around like an idiot, great acting...? Not really... His other scenes are better and probably deserves the award for Best Actor this year, but is it top 50 of all-time? No. It's a mash-up of Taxi Driver and Falling Down which are better movies and the former has a better performance with DeNiro for sure, Douglas is probably comparable in the later. It didn't need the ""Batman"" stuff and probably cheapens the film. I liked it, expected more and felt we should have had it.",Christian P,4

08-Jan-20,"Joaquin Phoenix had some big shoes to fill after such performances by Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, and Heath Ledger, but his take on the Joker is definitely one to watch. In fact, it's almost impossible to take your eyes off the screen because you're worried Arthur Fleck is going to sneak up and attack you. This origin story of the Clown Prince of Crime is a well-made drama, grounded in reality, but riddled with delusional fantasy.",Joel H,4

08-Jan-20,"I thought it was beautifully shot, perfectly paced, well written and that Joaquin Phoenix put in an absolutely stellar performance. It's incredibly relevant for our times and serves as a dark reflection of our troubled society. I felt the backlash was undeserved and, in part at least, politically motivated. This is a piece of art, and as such should be free to explore difficult topics as the director sees fit. I loved it. 5/5.",Graeme C,5
08-Jan-20,"Best acting Phoenix has ever done. Thought provoking. Ignore the bullied, mentally ill, poor and marginalized individuals in our world, and they will come back to bite you. It plays out every day in our society, and the people in power who can do something about it choose to do nothing, leaving the rest of us to be fodder. I think all did a great job at putting this film together. Lighting, angles of shots, good writing, and GREAT acting make this a must see movie.",Antonette D,5

08-Jan-20,"I have been a Batman fan ever since i can remember, and as great as the Christopher Nolan adaptations were, after watching this move it makes the previous jokers seem inadequate. Jared Letos need not be mentioned. and Heath Ledgers while amazing, has no real place in Gotham, he is a mercenary who donned some makeup to fight an equally deranged person. Here we have the realism without fantasy DC universe which can set up a whole franchise, simply because, this Joker unlike any of the ones before feels, acts, and behaves like someone in the real world would. Hopefully this can lead to a new generation of Batman films where he is no longer an action figure but a true detective, solving crimes, trying to catch Joker, and other villains. This film is not only a masterpiece of the DC universe but films in general. Its focus on Joker and his transformation is unlike any other. you can feel it minute by minute. his fall, and derangement overcoming him. This movie gives me hope not only to future movies but for the DC universe which is in dire need of revival. This is it. Thank you Joaquin for your portrayal of the most important villain of my childhood, and thank you everyone who worked on this film.",Patryk D,5

It made me feel for a character that i knew is bad, and that i watched doing bad things, it offered enough context to make his actions and motivations believable. I don't think i've ever seen a crazy killer have such a believable motivation in a movie before.

It made the Joker creepy, yet you feel some degree of sympathy for him. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",Michael T,5

He's very hopeful to smash the hatred with his comedy and spread love, laughter & peace but got bullied for ages and now, he's very angry with that, starts loses his cool after continuously challenging his mental state - transforming him into a criminally minded person - Joker. He feels betrayed by the world, he lives in. All his life, he suffers and lives just in one thought, that one day he might make difference with his comedy and will spread smiles on other faces but what he got in return is pure hate. And after so many efforts and resistances, he finally erupts, what he's consuming throughout and decides to kill who is rude, arrogant and deceitful. This starts only when he knows that he has nothing to lose. That is where mental illness worsts the life of such people. Radiating a positive vibe in every situation, standing for the wrong floor and fight to change this pathetic world of aversion in hopes and optimism. BUT After continuously failing, he crosses the path, took the opposite parallel track of what he's running on. The path, that is dangerous for this fake HAPPY world, who talks about peace and shits and keeps sucking the blood of poor and weak people. He's now turning the plates, taking the revenge. And mistakenly, triggered a riot in his own town Gautam city. Now everyone is wearing Joker masks and supporting him. It's like, he starts a revolution against the system, against the corrupt government, against the insolent, raspy & disgusting world. "" It's like watching yourself surrounded by the lights of the moon into the darkness of this edged world. Full of wretched people tearing down the streets and wrecking up the democracy "" There's were so many scenes, which every aspiring filmmaker wants to portray in their film. The director & writer Todd Phillips, Scott Silver (co-writer) did a fantastic job, creating this negative aura to develop the character of DC Comic in such a way that compels him to crosses the path. This is a sort of prequel of Dark knight (Batman series) without any ties, created their subplots to apprise the story of how Joker rises - takes us inside the brain of the Joker and states how he become one. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher shoots this film by using vivid shades of light, with respective camera angles to enhance the cinematic experience. May have some flaws in the screenplay but the actor Joaquin Phoenix stunned us and lifted the film through his magical magnificent performance. He's brilliant in his own way of creating this pessimistic universe, Just like Heath Ledger did in Dark Knight, sucks the loathe and lived up the role of Joker. The very last screen of the film, the lawless situation created by the clowns - riots to help, escape the Joker from police custody was ambitiously amazing. Hoping for the Sequel ..",Samkit J,4

If Jacquie Phoenix doesn�t win an Oscar, I swear I will have no faith in the judges ever again. How he was able to pull off this character that had so many personalities and ticks is unbelievable. I honestly have to think that he allowed himself to simply go crazy in order to pull off this character so well. I�ve actually watched it twice because it�s so easy to miss the various points being made. But my biggest take away is perspective. It gives perspective to all of the Batman movies and honestly many other things in life. All my life I�ve watched Batman fight these bad guys, especially the joker! Thinking nothing of what happened to the �man� to make him become the �joker�. It was incredible. If you�re looking for upbeat action Batman style movie, then this is not your movie. If you want a thought provoking movie that forces you to evaluate your perspective on mental health then this is the movie for you!",Tornado Tara,5
06-Jan-20,"As advertised, Phoenix is PHENOMENAL!!! The movie has alot to say about the role we all play in creating the monsters of the world. It overstates the case, but is awesome nonetheless. MUST SEE!!",Jay R,5

06-Jan-20,in my opinion it's a movie of the decade! extraordinary with the wonderful role of joaquin phoenix,Tomasz D,5
06-Jan-20,"The Joker tries to be a complex psychological drama and a very predictable comic book movie at the same time. So it's got none of the tension of a drama or the action of a comic book movie. Bad things just happen to Arthur because we need to drive home the point that his life sucks and everyone hates him. Why does he chase after kids in clown shoes for a simple cardboard sign? To get a beating. Why are the subway guys just assholes to random people when literally anyone in this crime-ridden city can have a gun and shoot you? So that Arthur becomes a killer. It's boring. The rest is just predictable: kills mom/girlfriend, gets revenge on comedian, escapes jail/Arkham. Nothing happens in this movie. People saw Heath Ledger's Joker in the Dark Knight and thought it's a good idea to try and mimic that and make an entire movie out of it. Heath's Joker worked well because of Nolan's mastery of directing and the great chemistry he shared with Batman. He wasn't just a ""craaaaaazy"" mentally ill man.",Alvin C,2
06-Jan-20,"The Joker is without a doubt one of the best villains of all time. Top 3 if not Top 5. All the versions over the years have been Unique in their own way, Romero, Nicholson, Hamill, Ledger and even Letto. But for them they have always had the one thing in common... BATMAN. Batman is in every version, the ying to their yang, The Moriati to their Sherlock...or vise versa. This version.... there is no Batman. No need for anarchy and chaos, So how can he exist? Arthur Fleck, is a tormented soul. Delusions of grandeur. He aspires to be a comedian yet he isn't any good. He suffers from all kinds of mental issues, so you never know if he is imagining what is going on or not. He is constantly bullied, put down to the breaking point. Till he eventually snaps. Which is an interesting aspect of the character we haven't ever seen before. The transition is something I think is very well done, instead of just one thing to trigger his transformation into ""The Joker"" its more a gradual build up of events that take place, like a volcano that slowly builds and builds till it hits breaking point and explodes. He wants fame, but they way he gets it is......awful but realises this is what it takes to get what he wants and will stop at nothing to get it. Phoenix deserves every bit of praise he receives for this role. Really an epic performance. Robert De Niro also is a stand out in a role I at first would be minimal. But it is bigger than first thought. Without giving to much away, I'll say this. IF your a fan of Batman and his greatest enemy of all time.... See it. Batman isn't in it but there is a little twist that makes it really ......interesting.",Jamie P,4
06-Jan-20,"I will appreciate the fact that they emphasized on the mental issues factor of joker's origin story. But even if this is a stand alone movie, I was hoping the film makers will connect this joker world into the DC world. But this story had so many mismatches from the batman movies, it felt incoherent at times. You can watch this for the acting and character development, but the story will put you to sleep. I am a screenplay/story sort of a person and hence my overall rating is lower for this movie. ScreenPlay -- 2/5 Story -- 2/5 Character development -- 5/5 Acting -- 5/5 Cast -- 5/5 Visuals, sound and editing -- 4/5 End movie Feel -- Felt like this could have been much more.

06-Jan-20,"'Joker' presents a character who cried out for love, pleaded for his innocence yet could only be forcefully broken by the hands of his society. Phoenix relishes the role and brings the arc of Arthur Fleck to a harrowing reality. This comic book film is a momentous change to the concept of the hero and emphasises real global issues over the common glorified vision of the conquering of evil.",Jay R,4.5
06-Jan-20,Best movie I've seen in a while! The psychology behind why joker is this way is compelling. I loved the political aspect of it and it truly paints a picture in the way it should've.

05-Jan-20,"There's a load of references in there, which they show over and over again; the starting point isn't smart, so repeating it incessantly isn't either. Phoenix is amazing, as are a lot of the other cast members, but they can't save a lazy, derivative, predictable screenplay from failing. Also, regarding the soundtrack, they could've used a lot of era-appropriate and psychologically fitting new wave or punk, but instead they keep on copying Bernard Herrmann (taxi driver, don'tcha know) and using the same two Sinatra songs repeatedly. And it takes waaaay too long, treating the audience like toddlers. Yeah, i get it already. 6/10, purely for the performances and cinematography. The rest of it sucks.",Rick B,3
05-Jan-20,"In one phrase, it's a half-baked masterpiece. It had so much potential and even while watching the movie I thought it was epic. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that there were a lot of plot holes and many things which didn't make much sense. The fact that the movie is focused almost entirely on Arthur is beneficial and lets them complete an entire character arc in a single movie. The world building was well handled and there was sufficient character development. Many of the elements hit right on but others didn't do as well. There was nothing legendary, although most things did hit well. The progression of the Joker as a symbol of revolution within Gotham was also a very well managed aspect. The movie is disturbing in a good way, it gives you a genuine fear of Arthur in the last fifteen minutes. 7.5/10, it could've been a 9/10 if it had fixed up all its easily fixable flaws.",David A,4

05-Jan-20,"I just didnt like this movie. I dont know where to begin with it. I thought it was 2D and predictable. If I could have played plot point bingo before the movie had started every predictable thing you can think of occurs in this movie. People are bad to bad guy for no reason....check. Bad guy was abused as a boy....check. Society is in a state of upheaval....check. Try putting this joker in a society that is happy (the story completely falls down and doesnt work anymore) No society is all happy or unhappy it is a mixture of both. To paint it as all unhappy simply makes the environment 2D. I watched the movie all the way through out of some kind of voyeurism to see if this character could shock me but he couldnt. The comic book joker is way smarter, way nastier and more complex than this guy. If this movie did not have the iconic archetype of the joker to lean into it would be a barely above average shock movie. I was lead to beleive this movie had relevant social commentary that fit our times. I must have missed it cos it just seems like a 2d movie to me with no beleiveable depth whatsoever.",Liam H,2
05-Jan-20,"sorry. no amount of oscar grade acting will change the fact that this is a completely botched attempt at reflecting who joker is. he is not clumsy, he is ultra competent. he is not an average joe IQ guy, he is literally a strategic and tactical genius. and no amount of abuse could explain his true grit. he is evil. and the movie does gross injustice to all the people who have been abused but turned out good.

04-Jan-20,"The movies that I like the best are those ones that push boundaries and make you think long after the initial viewing and can be viewed many times over whilst maintaining it's enjoyment level. This is one of those movies. Naturally, I was aware of some of the controversy about the movie before watching it and I'm satisfied that the Studio and Producers acted appropriately. I was not aware of the matter of the use of the Garry Glitter music and was very surprised to here the Gary Glitter song during one of the pivotal scenes in the movie which clearly adds a significant level of dept to the story but was left want to make sure by doing this it had not profited Glitter in any way and I believe that is the case. I don't normally contribute on these forums but felt compelled to by seeing the low rating and I'm confident over time the rating will improve and this movie will be regarded as one of the best movies of all time. As a parent, you should take note of the classification where you may be flexible with other traditional comic book associated movies you should not in this instance. This is most definitely not a movie that is suitable for children.",Paul C,5
04-Jan-20,"9.25/10. As deeply disturbing and difficult to watch as it is ultimately compelling, Joker is as satisfying an origin story as you could want for perhaps the most recognizable villain in comic book history. It's cynicism is uncomfortable to the point of becoming nearly unbearable, but only because the social commentary rings true and resonates so clearly. The screenplay stands on it's own two feet, capable of independence from the Batman source material but enriched for retaining the Gotham setting. Director/writer Todd Phillips takes a massive leap forward compared to previous works, and Joaquin Phoenix turns in a Oscar-worthy (yet standard for him) performance as the titular character. An incredible picture if you can stomach it.",Jesse D,4.5

The acting (particularly Phoenix) is Oscar worthy. It completely invests you in every moment and takes you inside the head of a man who has undergone so much trauma. It generates all the right emotions at the right times. You sympathize with him when you should. You fear him when you should.

04-Jan-20,"By comparing Joker to the Korean film parasite we can avoid some of the partisanship and misconceptions that muddy the waters and allow them to be appreciated for what they are. Both were directed by Directors directors at the peak of their creative powers and control - the Korean director of the Host came to his project as a man already considered to be a genius, while few expected something like Joker this from the director of Hangover. both films are concerned with the abyss between the 1 % and the 99 %. It is important to point out that neither use violence in an exploitative way, especially in a culture in which films with absurd levels of violence and gore effects as well as a cynical attitude sell lots of tickets and get good ratings on rotten tomatoes. Both are black comedies that are scathing in their social criticism but yet retain a sense of perspective. Everyone is seen as a human being. I respect both Parasite and Joker as master classes in filmmaking, but it is important to understand why I still like Joker a lot more. You see, Parasite locates its camera in a family who are firmly ensconced in the 1 %. This results in a movie that sees everything from their point of view really even though the heroes have slipped into their lives like bedbugs into the satin sheets of a four-star hotel. The result is a kind of British movie of manners. On the other hand I'm much more identify myself as one of the 99 % as I directly identify with many of the things that happen to the Joker's struggling comedian as he sinks in the ocean of underclass misfortunes. This results in me really liking Joker more because it is a setting in events and cast that belonged to a world I identify with. While I have seen Parasite twice, I don't want to climb up the hill to that families house again really. Been there, done that. I actually look forward with avid interest to going back to the world of the Joker and seeing who else amongst Batman's pantheon of predators might have a story to tell.",Leo Rivers,4.5
04-Jan-20,"this movie is great, awesome, unique, and the best of all is joaquin's performance.

04-Jan-20,"honestly, i waited till a few weeks ago to watch it simply because i felt like the trailers just made it look like another stupid Hollywood ""white man bad, love it or you're (insert insult here)"" but it was actually pretty amazing, Todd Phillips and Joaquin phoenix did an amazing job making a movie that's not only original (which is a rarity in Hollywood these days) but that's a constant roller coaster that keeps you guessing right up to the end while at the same time putting up a mirror to society in general that we've become so one-sided and PC that we vilify and destroy those we view as different. Just don't listen to the media because, if anything, they've managed to prove the movie's point that they're as much, if not more, to blame for the divisiveness in our society as the rest of us. if you're looking for a great movie, filled with clever twists that gives us all a look at joker, not as some evil mastermind who causes chaos for the sake of chaos, but rather as a mentally disturbed loner who gets pushed to the brink of insanity by what our society does best, then Joker is a great film to see",kevin b,5

He eventually falls completely into madness and begins his killing spree for what he believes to be a good reason, the ongoing uprisings in Gotham, their figurehead being a clown, inspires him to commit more heinous acts.

The Joker portrayed in this movie was just an ordinary criminal who didn't require a superhero like Batman to be caught.

03-Jan-20,"-Definitely need to rewatch to fully understand what happened. -Story seems regular but it's the actual journey of the film that makes it so amazing. -We truly do live in a society. A horrible one at that that treats mental illness horridly. -I love the mixture of what's real and what isn't occurring in the film. It truly makes you doubt what is happening. -Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job. He's so haunting and demented in this movie. It's spectacular. -Truly a movie that disturbs you much like how the Joker should. -You really understand why someone like that would go crazy, maybe even why so many other people in the real world go crazy or just do crazy things. The world keeps pushing them down. So how else can someone who's been through this react?",Lizzy B,5

02-Jan-20,"I'm Team Scorsese in that I am simply not made for superhero movies. With the possible exceptions of the Cathy Lee Crosby ""Wonder Woman"" (1974; made for TV), the Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" (1978), ""Flash Gordon"" (1980) and ""Deadpool"" (2016), I tend to tune out anything too comic bookish. Therefore, I was reluctant to give ""Joker,"" the billion-dollar-grossing white-rage flick directed by Todd Phillips of (ugh!) ""The Hangover Trilogy"" (2009-2013) fame from his script with Scott Silver, a fair shot. I'm glad I relented, because this is not a superhero movie. Yes, there is a Batman vignette toward the end, and yes, Joaquin Phoenix plays the one and only Joker, but aside from that, this movie has much more in common with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) and ""The King of Comedy"" (1983) than movies about dudes in tights. A simmering, searing story of how little guys and misfits can be pushed into becoming psychopaths, ""Joker"" is a mind-fuck from minute one, and a harrowing look at populist anger. Perhaps the most memorable scene occurs when Joker snaps and murders an odious bully, stranding an acquaintance who happens to be a little person (Leigh Gill) in the room with him. The film makes a visual joke out of the man's inability to reach a doorknob in order to get away, but rather than being a cheap shot, I felt it was a cunning way of putting the audience in that terrified witness's place, ratcheting up the suspense and his feeling of helplessness in the face of an unhinged loner, and, indeed, our collective helplessness in the face of a society of unhinged loners. I absolutely loved this movie; I can almost forgive Phillips for ""The Hangover's"" ""paging Dr. ..."" Almost.",Matthew R,5

Upon re-watching The Dark Knight a few days after seeing this one, I am going back to up my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars. I think the character study alone makes this movie fascinating, but the other elements make it fantastic and much better than any typical super hero film, even a Batman one.",Evan O,4
01-Jan-20,"A masterful work of art. Todd Phillips truly directed a masterpiece and Joaquin Phoenix excels by bringing the audience into Arthur Fleck's world. Take away comic books and the DC name.

01-Jan-20,"I wasn't stoked about this movie because come on� ANOTHER movie with ANOTHER actor playing the Joker? Warner Brothers is really milking it dry. But I'll say this for it: this rendering of the character is different than any version of the Joker that you've seen before. This film is quite a departure for director Todd Phillips, who is known for his comedies, e.g. ""The Hangover"", ""Old School"", ""Road Trip"", etc. But there is nothing funny about this movie; it's dark and ominous and very, very serious (""Why so serious???""). This is definitely a different kind of movie for a so-called comic-book film � there is no action, no excitement, and no fun whatsoever. Not a whole lot happens in this movie; it's not interested in delivering a typical action/adventure story, it is solely devoted to doing a deep dive into the character and his motivation. The film is actually done well - it knows what it is and what it's trying to be, and it's successful in that. But holy lord, is it SLOW. Painfully slow. There is no momentum; the movie never really gets moving and the payoff at the end is not enough to justify the two hours of slow burn that come before it. But this film is a character study, so if you love this character and can bear the sluggish pacing, you will probably like it. Joaquin Phoenix turns in a terrific performance; he really is great and truly embodies the character� though Phoenix is such a nutcase, who can tell if this is a performance at all? It kinda seems like it's just him. Regardless, I'd rank his interpretation of the character just behind Heath Ledger's in ""The Dark Knight""� and Ledger defined this role, so that's quite a feat. In exploring Joker's origin, the film really digs deep into his mental illness. While I appreciate the attention to that part of the character (that he's not an anarchist just to be an anarchist), this movie perpetuates the myth that people with mental illness are dangerous. It bothers me, especially in this day and age, but I really don't know how that could be avoided� mental illness so embedded up in the mythology of the Joker, you really can't remove it from his story. The movie also explores themes of classism and economic oppression, but there are many movies that have done it better and certainly more concisely. I appreciated how the ending ties in to the traditional Gotham City/Batman lore, especially how Joker obtains his insane clown posse. But at the end of the day, this is an origin story we did not need, and the whole movie is a bit pointless. You won't miss anything by skipping it.",Dana F,2.5

The man is a master of his craft and this film is a must-see.,Michael R,5
31-Dec-19,I liked the story in spite many people saying it's average. It was necessary to tackle Joker's character physiologically and tell his background story. I will watch it again. Joaquin Phoenix is just brilliant!,Bojana B,4
31-Dec-19,"Todd Phillips delivered a much better movie than what I was hearing from no less than half of the people who watched it before me. I guess that was the benefit of waiting until it came out on blu-ray. This was almost what the comic book genre needed and when I say that, I mean that Joker was just an inch away from being the psychological thriller that CB and films fans alike could agree upon. There was just something missing, something that could have made this movie one of the best psychological thrillers of time... depth. The story of Arthur Fleck is just missing the overall punch that made Black Swan and The Sixth Sense so great. I walked away wishing there was more to the character. Here's to hoping the second film adds to that. I will say that this movie would not have worked with any other actor besides Joaquin Phoenix, one of the best actors to ever grace the screen.",Kenton V,4.5

The story had you watch the downfall of Author Fleck and had you pulling for him the entire movie and made you feel bad for him whenever anything goes wrong with him. By the end of the movie he had made his full transition into the Joker and did a good job at getting to that point by not rushing it. I recommend this movie to everyone!",Carter D,5

30-Dec-19,"Joker ist der kontroverseste Film des Jahres. Er ist n�mlich, so sagen es viele, gewaltverherrlichend. Die Meinungen �ber Joker gehen auch ziemlich auseinander. Die einen lieben den Film, die anderen finden, dass Joker nur j�mmerlich versucht, Teile von The Dark Knight nachzuahmen. Ich finde, dass Joker zu allererst einmal ein Film ist, �ber den es sich zu sprechen lohnt. Story: Arthur Fleck ist ein erfolgloser Clown. Er leidet an einer psychischen Krankheit, durch die er manchmal einfach drauflos lachen muss. Er steht schon ganz unten in der Gesellschaft und nachdem seine Therapie beendet und seine Medikamente gestrichen wurden und er seinen Job verloren hat, entschlie�t er sich, drei gutbezahlte Mitarbeiter der erfolgreichsten Firma der Stadt zu erschie�en, als diese in nachts in der U-Bahn zusammenschlagen. Der Chef dieser Firma, Thomas Wayne sagt daraufhin im TV, dass alle Personen, die Verbrechen begehen, Clowns sind und so entsteht eine Clownsbewegung und ein Arthur Fleck alias Joker, der immer verr�ckter wird. Kritik: Joker ist eigentlich ein Superheldenfilm. Er basiert n�mlich auf den DC Comics rund um Batman, in denen Joker regelm��ig als Gegenspieler auftritt. Doch Joker f�hlt sich �berhaupt nicht wie ein Superheldenfilm an. Joker f�hlt sich eher wie ein Gesellschaftsdrama mit brutalen T�tungsszenen an. Joker ist au�erdem nicht f�r Jedermann. Personen, die Gewalt in Filmen nicht so gut abk�nnen, sollten ihre Finger definitiv von Joker lassen. Das Wichtigste bei einem Film mit Joker ist wahrscheinlich die Verk�rperung von Joker und das Schauspiel. Denn nur wer die Rolle von Joker auch richtig ernst nimmt und seine komplette Leidenschaft f�rs Schauspielern in die Rolle steckt, kann der Rolle auch gerecht werden. W�hrend Jared Leto 2016 noch von Kritikern und Fans zerrissen wurde, schafft es Joaquin Phoenix diesmal Fans und Kritiker a la Heath Ledger zu begeistern. Ob er auch besser als Heath ist, dar�ber l�sst sich streiten. Ich bin dazu neutral, aber finde auch, dass Joaquin seinen Job mehr als gut gemacht hat. Nicht nur ist das Schauspiel klasse und die Story erfrischend, die Kamera, die Musik und vor allem der Look der 80er ist toll und die Gewaltszenen sind wie erwartet brutal, halten sich aber, was die Anzahl der Szenen angeht, etwas zur�ck. Auch �ber die Aussage, das Joker gewaltverherrlichend sei, l�sst sich streiten. Klar kann man das finden, aber ich finde, das Actionfilme in denen die Actionszenen oder z.B. der Krieg als was Cooles und Aufregendes dargestellt werden, viel eher gewaltverherrlichend. Zum Abschluss kann ich Joker all denen empfehlen, die mal etwas Anderes als immer die selben Remakes oder f�nften Teile eines Franchises sehen wollen. Denn Joker ist ein guter Film, der sich, auch endlich mal was traut. Und von solchen Filmen brauchen wir viel mehr in Hollywood.",Yaron V,4.5

Joaquin Phoenix delivers a truly mesmerizing performance that I think will live on for awhile!!",Michael K,5

30-Dec-19,"One of the best adaptation of the most known villain of Batman in DC comics in films, Joker is definitely worth to watch for DC heroes fans. It serves the best origin story and standalone film of Joker and I can't help but praise its cinematic quality from acting, sounds, setting, plot up to cinematography. The story is in-depth with the character of the mentally-ill loner Joker and darker in tone like the Dark Knight trilogy films. And Joaquin Phoenix playing the titular laughing retarded clown turned crime murderer gave an Oscar-worthy performance that I think is the best performance of a Joker character to date! Phoenix carried whole character and justified Joker's origin story and how he came to be a villain we will never forget. He carried the whole movie effectively that even though there's caution for violence and language in the film, his performance along with a well-written story is guaranteed to be one of the best movie of 2019 and the whole decade!",Ian Roger P,4.5

29-Dec-19,"The point of the ambiguous ending isn't to ask whether or not the events of the film are real but to ask whether you want the events to be real, and what your preferred interpretation demonstrates about you and society. If you prefer to believe that everything in the film is happening inside of Arthur's head as he speaks to a social worker at Arkham Asylum, then you do not want to believe that a person like Arthur poses a threat to society. If you believe that people celebrated Arthur as a hero and that his actions caused chaos, then you agree with Joker. When the chips are down, these people will each other. If you believe that the cop car was not t-boned by an ambulance, then you believe Arthur will get what he deserves and that he will pay for his crimes, or at least, that he should be punished. In each case, the interpretation implies something problematic about how we think about madness, violence and human nature.",Adam F,4.5

29-Dec-19,Great performances. Stunning visuals and a disturbing message make this a unique but amazing film.,Chase B,4.5
29-Dec-19,"Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for this one. Batman co-creator Jerry Robinson once said, ""heroes are dull, they have to win, but villains are much more interesting"". As a product of the trashy late 70s I appreciate how ugly and stinky and broken America felt, and Phoenix owned the teeter totter dance of going antihero or possibly mediocre standup comic with a decent apartment. I even enjoyed seeing him 86 one of my fav actors. Who made Batman? Joker. Who made Joker? Dirty Gotham in '81",Dan D,4.5
29-Dec-19,"Great directing, acting, and storyline!",John B,5
29-Dec-19,Phoenix's performance was masterfully acted albeit cringeworthy. His portrayal was not at all in tune with who/what The Joker is supposed to be in my mind.,John F,2.5

29-Dec-19,Meh. They took what might have been an entertaining half hour of film and stretched it out to 2+ hours.,,1
29-Dec-19,"Dark, provocative, and certainly not for everyone, Joker presents an interesting and thought-provoking origin for one of the most famous comic-book villains of all time, while also creating a good canvas to paint a character study on those struggling in society.",Ethan B,5
29-Dec-19,Amazing acting by Joaquin Phoenix. Really puts him on his own level when it comes to the acting game. His range is unmatched and he perfected this role. Great story line for an origin story and will change the way you look at both mental health and comic book stories. A must see for anyone who likes amazing acting performances.,,4.5

29-Dec-19,Excellent portrayal of mental illnesses role in society cleverly guised in the superhero (villain) film format that is popular with the modern movie goer. Excellent film but not your typical action hero faire...,William B,4.5
29-Dec-19,A disturbing yet beautiful story that tests our thoughts and prejudices towards mental illness and a story about a world on the edge of revolt. Timeless. Genius.,David R,5
29-Dec-19,started slow but it all came together in the end,Mike A,4
29-Dec-19,Creepy but creepy with purpose. This was a dark film with deep characters. I walked away with more empathy than I entered with. The movie really explored mental illness in a way that society normally shys away from.,Lauren M,5

29-Dec-19,Very good movie. It was a little slow at first. But it was very realistic.,,4
29-Dec-19,"This is probably my favorite movie of 2019. I thought the trailers looked alright, but I went in not expecting much, but I came out end up loving it. This movie is a masterpiece. I'll give it an outstanding 11/10",Phoenix R,5

28-Dec-19,"This movie is just perfect, everything. The mysterious character, the music, the history, this movie is amazing where we can really understand the feelings of the Joker. No totally illogical moments like in like much movies nowadays",Svarog G,5
28-Dec-19,This is the highlight film of the decade. What an amazing portrait by Joaquin Phoenix of the Clown prince of crime - Oscar-buzz!?,Chan Y,5
28-Dec-19,"This is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. Forget that it's about a comic book character. Like Fight Club, the character development in this film has many twists and turns and requires several viewings to fully appreciate the plot and development. If this film does not win most of the awards this year and Joaquin Phoenix does not get best actor, I will treat the Academy the same way I treat the US Congress. I will ignore them from here on out. They will be useless and utterly irrelevant, fully worthy of the contempt and detestation of all film goers everywhere. Finally, a movie based on a comic book that rises above the silliness of most of these films like a phoenix from the ashes of tripe.",Don S,5
28-Dec-19,Outstanding performance of J. Phoenix and shocking story of a character that may not be the villainous clown that we always imagined after all.,Miguel A,4.5

28-Dec-19,"I was very surprised about how great Pheonix could portray the Joker. Awesome movie, that conveys feelings in a very unique way. When something about Arthur's feelings changes, it's not just his face that shows it - it's his whole persona that tells you.",T.K. A,5

28-Dec-19,"Disturbing, and troubling commentary on the current state of society. Ending provokes discussion. Worth seeing, but wouldn't say it necessarily requires to be seen on the big screen.",Joe Whichever,3.5
28-Dec-19,"Phoenix performance is one of the most captivating I've seen in a film for a very long time, he makes you sympathise and connect with the character of the joker in way that has never been done before, all of which builds up to a hugely satisfying climax creating one of the best films of the decade",Sonny F,5
28-Dec-19,Fantastic! Vital movie in bringing awareness to the mental health crisis that faces the world today.,Omar R,5
28-Dec-19,"Joker es impresionante, lo de Joaquin Phoenix es majestuoso. Definitivamente contiene la mejor escena del 2019.",Carlos J,4
28-Dec-19,"I don't see what all the fuss is about. The plot was okay. Joaquin's acting was pretty good. But just a dull, unexciting ride from beginning to end. The plot and ending was easily figured out well before the end. De Niro's character was irrelevant. The 'back story' about Joker was shallow, unimpressive, and stale. I wouldn't waste my time watching it again. I'd be sorely disappointed if there was a sequel.",Scott N,2
28-Dec-19,"The movie doesn't deserve Oscars, the Oscars deserve it",Ruhi S,5
28-Dec-19,one of the best movies i have ever seen!!,Marcus M,5
28-Dec-19,"'Joker' surprised me this winter. It may be a little bit of a slow burn, but that slow burn works very nicely as a character build-up. I was surprised this was made by the writer of Road Trip, Borat and The Hangover (parts 1 through 22). Anyone who likes mindless bang boom blockbuster DC / Marvel movies, stop reading and go find something else to see, like that masterpiece (ahem) Deadpool or its sequel. If you are tired of those cookie-cutter superhero flicks, read on. 'Joker' is a DC universe super tragedy. There's an unease about everything on screen from the get go, and it doesn't let off. While reading so-called 'reviews' by professional 'critics', I've noticed how scared many people are of mental illness and the way we deal with it in our modern society. This movie - set in 1981 - serves as a nice mirror for all of us, and the low critic score on RT and in general says more about the people writing the reviews than it says about the movie itself. Joaquin Phoenix portrays an excellently miserable character, who tries and tries but gets consumed by society and his own demons over and over again. Best performance by a male lead character in a while. Unsettling, dangerous, real and confrontational. Anyone asking for a hero character instead of this tragic lead has not understood anything about this movie.",Rudy M,5
28-Dec-19,One of the best movies of 2019. A masterpiece commentary about how a society treats its weakest and powerless citizens. Joaqu�n Phoenix gives the performance of his career. I highly recommended it.,Mariela R,5
28-Dec-19,Absolutely insane ride from start to finish,,5
28-Dec-19,"Great movie. Very funny and dark origin story for this character. Definitely not as flashy and action packed as your average superhero movie, but who needs another one of those. This one shows a lot more humanity, depth, and grit.",Erick C,5
28-Dec-19,"A decent film and a enjoyable decent into madness. I think the controversy around the film was for publicity, and not really deserved. All in all the film was tame and could have done with being a little bit more gritty and confronting. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was good for the most part, but at times it felt more like interpretive dance. I was a little sceptical going in, because one of the big things about the joker is the mystery surrounding his origin story, but I was satisfied with their version and the openness that it allows. Worth a watch, not sure it would be a film I would rewatch though.",Aaron P,3
28-Dec-19,Absolutely nailed it.,Chaaban R,5
28-Dec-19,Joaquin was masterful. Todd Philips made a gem.,Michael R,5
28-Dec-19,I found that it was an interesting movie but it was hard to follow and enjoy. The movie was a complete difference from everything else. It will be interesting to see what the director will do.,brian w,3
28-Dec-19,"Joker merece toda a aten��o possivel! � intrigante, � pesado, � escuro, � uma obra prima. Joaquim Phoenix entrega tudo neste filme ao ponto de fazer o espetador esquecer que est� a ver um filme. Toda a equipa est� de parab�ns.",Joo M,5
28-Dec-19,"Uma obra-prima do cinema de her�is e vil�es, um estudo de personagem envolvente e ao mesmo tempo perturbador, sem falar na atua��o magistral e digna de Oscar de Joaquin Phoenix.

28-Dec-19,A cinematic masterpiece.,Weston B,5
28-Dec-19,"An extremely solid outing for Mr. Phoenix. Without him the movie crumbles. Underwritten script, an absence in direction, and an overly bleak plot almost tank this movie. Mr. Phoenix's confidence, poise, and talent take this movie to the next level and without it I don't think it would work at all. I did enjoy the great cameo/supporting performance from Mr. DeNiro, too. Underused but solid.",Drew M,3.5

28-Dec-19,Not your typical Marvel or DC superhero movie. Phoenix is great in a disturbing and plausible non-superhero-like origin.,Fran L,3
28-Dec-19,"1 Sentence review-Remove the words ""joker"" +""gotham"" and the movie would be no different.",Tzatziki W,2
28-Dec-19,"As a Scorsese fan, it's interesting to hear his comments about comic book films. I somewhat agree with him, but Joker is different. It's a very dark, character study art house film about a comic book villain. Fantastic performances and visuals. A must see even if you don't like superhero movies.",frank c,4
28-Dec-19,"A truly evocative, but negative movie. A descent into madness, with full details, with fantasy overtones.................Phoenix is either the best actor in the whirled, or insane. Or both.",Russell L,3
28-Dec-19,"Was going to pass because it sounded too dark. But what a great surprise in terms of a brilliant depiction of a mentally unstable tortured man. A man who gets revenge for those who hurt him. A bit cathartic for anyone who has ever been bullied. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is pure genius: his uncontrollable laughter, his energetic dance upon the steps, his inward and outward pain. Best Actor, no doubt. Cameo by Robert DeNiro a plus. One of the finest acting performances I've ever seen. Well developed storyline. Edge of seat drama.",Callison D,5
28-Dec-19,Great acting great cinematography but just not on the bandwagon like everyone else this is someone�s interpretation of the joker which is fine everyone can have their opinion but this is not the �joker� if this movie was called fleck and take place in New York City it would make so much more sense,,4

28-Dec-19,Best movie in 2019! The acting was amazing.,Andrew C,5
28-Dec-19,Best movie of 2019. Phoenix will earn best actor nominations from this role.,Alex P,5
28-Dec-19,I thought it was dry. It had potential to have a good story line but the message wasn't there.,Joy A,3
27-Dec-19,"Horrible. A depressing poorly shot crap storm. Elongated shots on meaningless backgrounds. Poorly executed pregnant pauses. Horrendous �acting' by lead where he just redid his dead eye roles. It had enough draw that you desperately watch it to the end hoping it has to get better soon only to be completely let down. Sorry, brutal, but it was that bad.",Me M,0.5
27-Dec-19,A great watch. A film about compassion.,Rona R,4.5
27-Dec-19,"The darkness that this film starts out with and seems to want to suck you into transforms invisibly and brilliantly into an empathy grabbing crescendo that leaves the viewer questioning their own perspective on good and evil. One of the best movies of 2019 and a superb performance by Phoenix that does justice to his predecessor. Shocking, unsettling and unmissable.",Mike H,5

27-Dec-19,Joker Review: So what to start to this film the joker is not part of the dceu. But it is a dc movie it's basically a solo joker movie of how the origin of the joker were here and so this film tells it his own story and that was pretty clever by Warner bros and dc and I actually like this film. I feel so complicated about it. It was insane timeless realistic! Joaquin is an absolutely brilliant as joker he will win an Oscar for sure. I will be surprised overall I give this movie 9.5/10 great story telling of the joker if you are a superhero or a dc fan than you must see this!,Dominic R,4
27-Dec-19,"Loved the movie,however the theater was too cold.",Ralph L,4.5
27-Dec-19,One of the best DC movies of all time. Phoenix delivers the best performance of his career. While dark and slow to start Joker really delivers overall in a very good way.,,4
27-Dec-19,"It's been a very long time since a movie left me with so much food-for-thought, can't stop thinking about it and it just keeps getting better and better the more I reminisce it. Joaquin Phoenix's performance transcends his role, it's truly more than just a comic book villain. The cinematography is on another level and the soundtrack is the cherry on top of this golden cake. Movie of the year.",Sabas G,5
27-Dec-19,Fantastic performance by Joaquin Phoenix,Kevin B,4.5
27-Dec-19,"Driven by an Oscar worthy performance; surprisingly clever plot and a haunting score, Joker leaves you, not only with a true representation of the source character, but the rare chance to glimpse inside his perspective. It is a wonderfully creepy dance that stays with you for a day or so.",Evan D,5
27-Dec-19,One of the great films I've ever seen. The conversations that the movie starts is part of what makes it a great movie.,Patrick S,5
27-Dec-19,I literally fell in love with this film,Kamran H,5
27-Dec-19,"Just one word, ""Wow!"". I love a good backstory and this one definitely had one, disturbing as it was. Joaquin was brilliant in this role. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",Danielle F,5
27-Dec-19,i enjoyed this movie,Louay S,5
27-Dec-19,The meaning/plot of the movie is open to interpretation. We debated the meaning and actual plot line for hours afterwards.,Robert G,5
27-Dec-19,So well done. This portrayed the Joker in a way that you almost feel bad for the guy. You almost understand why he is the way he is as a villain. One of the most creative way that the Joker has been portrayed yet.,Gus S,3.5
27-Dec-19,This movie finally gaved fans what we thought was impossible and that's give The Joker a proper origin story. And for the Joker it can't be just any origin story it had to be multiple all at once. You can watch this movie and not know what's real and what isn't and the best part no matter what people say the real story is there is enough evidence to prove them wrong and right. It's the perfect origin story for Joker.,Javier G,5
27-Dec-19,"Joaquin Phoenix. Enough said, I don't have to go any further!",Michael P,5
27-Dec-19,I was very suprised by the movie. It was a very good movie. Well thought out in the story line and it was Good. I did think it was a little drug out.,,4
27-Dec-19,"Felt incredibly sad and needed to rethink about life. Joker did something amazing. I hope it raises awareness to many about people with mental illness pushed to violence after being shunned, bullied, and belittled. This is a problem with every society and we can always do better.",Sen A,4

27-Dec-19,"Joaquin Phoenixs version of Joker was stupendous. Jack Nicholson was cunning, calculating, yet campy when he played the Joker, Heath Ledger was animalistic, demented, visceral, unhinged and uncompromising in his performance. Joaquins take was unbelievable, unpredictable, cagey and fearless.",Google,5
27-Dec-19,They shouldn�t have used a comic book character to depict the story line. This is too real and it could represent the idea that you can star killing people because you�ve been bullied. Columbine High anyone?,Tom,0.5
27-Dec-19,A humanization of the most complex and narcissistic comic villain of all time. Joaquin Phoenix played it perfectly and Todd Philips took this in a dark direction that truly brought forth the disturbing character the joker always represented. Well done and worth your time.,Daniel B,4.5
27-Dec-19,"Not the traditional DC movie. It is hard to imagine someone as the Joker in a post-Ledger world. Joaquin Phoenix delivers depth and complexity to rival the best Joker portrayals. The story is a little different than the standard Joker backstory, but that is OK. It helps understand why the character became who he is. It also highlights the trials of someone experiencing a mental illness. It is a well-done addition to the Joker's story.",RJ S,5
27-Dec-19,Awesome! Love it! Phoenix was incredible,Gonzalo O,5
27-Dec-19,"Incredible and glorious movie, it is very good to reflect what happens in the world, also shows the origin of the character from another point of view, without a doubt amazing.",Jere D,5

27-Dec-19,obra maestra digna de ver muchas veces y de ganar todos los premios,destruktor d,5
26-Dec-19,"Joker is no masterpiece but it is a showcase for a masterful actor giving one of the best performance of the year, it's captivating and gripping but some elements feal to familiar and beats that have been hit before in better films such as king of comedy and taxi driver are too often commanding the story. Every character except Fleck is formulaic and basic to the point of hilarity but this is all to easily overlooked when time is instead given to giving an all too believable backstory to cinemas greatest villain.",Matt T,4
26-Dec-19,"This movie is great. A little dark at times, but that is about it.",Trevor D,4.5
26-Dec-19,Feels as if it is trying to make too many points at once. Does not follow through on any. Better use of time to watch Taxi Driver and King of Comedy instead of this movie which feels like a pop culture mashup t-shirt of the two with Joker as the title characters.,Kyle D,2
26-Dec-19,Absolutely love this movie. I thought Joaquin Phoenix gave an exceptional performance. Does it say anything about the critics score when this movie is up for most Oscar nominations than any movie this year including best-picture?,Andrew S,5

26-Dec-19,"I loved this version of the Joker, but it still doesnt beat Heath Ledger. 80%",,4
26-Dec-19,Personally not a fan. Felt the story moved too slowly. Unnecessary moments that just go on for too long.I knew what I was getting into within the first two minutes of the film. Joaquin Phoenix killed it though. It was a mesmerizing performance which saved the movie for me.,MaraLee L,2.5
26-Dec-19,"Huge slog, barely a movie.",Owen W,0.5
26-Dec-19,"This one is dark, both substantively and visually � didn't notice any sunshine until the final scene. Phoenix, unsurprisingly, is masterful as the titular character, from his gaunt figure to the delivery of his lines (and laugh). It is an entertaining challenge to determine what is real and what is solely in Joker's head. The transformation is a slow burn with a huge payoff. Definitely an origin story for the Joker with the seeds planted for Bruce Wayne. Only real critiques are that he should've explained himself better on the night show, should change the song for the dancing steps scene, and end the movie one scene earlier. Joker is definitely a must-watch.",Ben D,5
26-Dec-19,Briliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix who was perfectly guided thru the film by Todd Phillips.,Mateusz W,5

26-Dec-19,Brutal pel�cula una fotograf�a espectacular y un Joaquin Phoenix sublime que te hace sentir el dolor y la frustraci�n del personaje es de lo mejor de este a�o sin duda. Es de las pocas pelis que me ha dejado totalmente inmerso en ella sintiendo la locura del personaje y las situaciones por las que pasa. Cuando cre�a que el joker de Heath Ledger era insuperable vemos a este joker de Joaquin Phoenix que para mi gusto es muy superior. No importa cuanto escriba la peli hay que sentirla si no la has visto ya est�s tardando.,Aron D,5

26-Dec-19,"Far from glorifying or enciting violence, I found JOKER to be a sad and compelling descent into madness with a strong central performance by Jaoquin Phoenix. While the social commentary is anything but subtle, I felt it was successful in examining the short-comings of mental healthcare and the rise of mob violence in our society. I do not think JOKER is a masterpiece and I do not need a sequel, but I was thoroughly moved and engaged from start to finish.",Jeff C,4
26-Dec-19,"it was a bait and switch, it's a political statement movie, that they named after a super hero character to get people to come watch it.. Phoenix was really disrespectful , not even able to put down his smoke to be able to act.. his addiction was on full display",Abel W,1.5
26-Dec-19,"GREAT history, not the normal joker, is a good movie, but the comic joker was a gangster, Violent, not a victim.",Irving G,4
26-Dec-19,"Not only does Phoenix elevate the titular character into another unforgettable incarnation, but he also pours so much emotions into his performance, you can't help but be captivated by it. On top of that you got a very refreshing take on comic book storytelling, with a lot of emphasis on character development, story and themes. Although the movie tells a very personal story, it's philosophical debate about classism feels epic and timeless. It will probably not only be the most unpredictable and entertaining movie you will see this year, but also the most stimulating. Just don't expect a typical action flick; it's anything but that.",Sean P,5
26-Dec-19,An origin story second. A realistic movie about mental illness first. Mr Phoenix adds to his list of award worthy performances with this DC movie that has so very little to do with the DCU. And doesnt need to. I was not interested in this movie at all because I really didnt believe anyone could top Heath Ledgers portrayal of the character. Joaquin at least makes it a close race at a minimum. Not a happy ending type of film but one that sticks with you much longer than a comic movie should.,Craig H,5

26-Dec-19,The movie is dark and provocative and Phoenix brings fans his own shadey edge to a great origin story of this comic book character. We need more darker story arches of our heros and villains out there besides the mainstream ones studios usually feed audiences. Kudos to Todd and WB for putting this out there.... The ambiguity is also fresh.... Loved it!,Russell D,5

Phoenix adds his name to the list of amazing performances for the Joker. Todd Phillips solidified himself as a powerhouse who just doesn't do raunchy movies. The soundtrack, great. Cinematography, great. Acting, unbelievable. Directing, amazing. How you're able to watch this movie and not need to know anything about Batman - great. But if you know a little about Batman - it makes it even better. Great, great, great movie. Excellent concept, excellent execution.",Erick F,5

25-Dec-19,The best DC film made outside of the Nolan-verse of Batman. An incredible character piece that dives into the mind of the Joker so well that you feel as though you are losing your mind with him.,,5

25-Dec-19,what a MASTERPIECE!!,Budd F,5
25-Dec-19,"Not gonna lie it was kind of rough to see someone suffer in this way. Especially when it's someone actively trying to get better from his illness. Watching his struggle with his illness while trying to remain a good son and pursue his dream and actively trying to better himself and life, while combating the real life struggles of insurance and government assistance programs failing, poverty and city crime beating him down much how it does in real life to many human beings. The chilling line of him saying he just doesn't want to feel so bad anymore cut into me having real life applications for the begining part of the story. Seeing people I love and care about suffer is so hard. And thats what makes this movie incredible! Not only does Joaquin slay this role but he also dedicated himself tp the role on a higher level much like Val Kilmer did for doc holliday. His sinister/awkward laugh makes it so much more enthralling. Keeping you on the edge of your seat wondering whats real or what psychotic break, wondering how could this get any worse or whats coming next!? It was amazing to see the whole story through and loved every part of it. I recommend if you're strong enough to withstand the anguish of his suffering and the dark nature of the film, see it! However again i dont feel its for the weak stomach not due to gore but more of the mental suffering and things of that nature. People really didn't like that it was a villain on a human level meaning it was such a real character that it scared people worse than a Dr Doom fantasy villain due to the real issues the movie touches on.",Tyler R,5

25-Dec-19,"It's very different from the other superhero comic book adaptations out there. And that's why I liked it so much. It's much darker and offers a very interesting and psychological origin story to the famous Joker character. It's a fascinating flick, showing us the hardships of living with a mental illness, as well as showing us the dangers of too many social inequalities. It's a pic with a lot of strong content to it. It's also a brilliant character study. And Joaquin Phoenix gives a terrific performance as the perturbed character who is beaten down by society, and later becomes the murderous Joker. Overall, I found this movie to be fascinating and very, very good. It's a cinematic phenomenon and one of the best movies of 2019. Recommended for sure!!",Brian S,4.5

25-Dec-19,"�Joker� could be one of the most brilliant movies I�ve ever watched. Joaquin Phoenix�s performance as the title character is brilliant, as is the world building and character development. Some people think it sympathizes with people who are so broken that they commit terrible acts, when in reality, it warns of the ways people can inadvertently cause a man to become this sad and lonely.

Everyone snap and rebels, not just Joker.",TomG,5
24-Dec-19,"I don't understand any of the animus against Joker. Aside from the brilliant performance, superior direction and production, this is a topical and important film. I recently read a review in which the critic pondered whether the movie should be lauded for its artistic quality or locked in a box and tossed into the ocean. Exactly. That's what makes good art great... uncanny attraction and discomfort bulging in the same pulse.",Lance H,5

However, by the final scene of Joaquin Phoenix's masterful pretrial, I was hooked, caught and sold. Retrospectively, the more time away from the film, the more it sat with me, and the more I realized how much I enjoyed; Joker. Yes, I would have liked it to be a more ""comic-book-ie"", but as it stands, it is definitely worth the watch if you're at all interested in the roots of clown prince of crime. Joaquin is the man.

I did not, however, like the ending and the movie's attempt at being mysterious, this movie did not need that extra level, it was wasted.",Leopold S,3.5
23-Dec-19,"After watching this movie at a late night showing just days ago, I feel torn over what I saw. It brought to mind films from the golden age of cinema, films like Taxi Driver, The Comedian and Dog Day Afternoon, but it was more then that. Joaquin's Joker is a pure art work, which just so happens to be set in the DC comic universe, but more then that it is a solid performance with a fascinating take on 75 year old character. I'm going to need to watch this movie a few more times but at this stage I can say with confidence that I liked it. I liked the acting, I liked the subplot and I liked that this film has stirred in the minds of so many. Did it wake the dragon? Time will tell. I hope that Warner Bros sees what happens when you hire the right people for a job.",Thomas S,4

23-Dec-19,"I went to watch Joker and it was one of the best character study films I have watched. Everything feels natural, it doesn't feel too snobbish like some character study films and it just makes you understand and relate to his pain... which may make you sick to your stomach that you can relate to someone as broken as Arthur Fleck, but that's the point. It's a cautionary tale, it's a tragedy despite what the main character says... and it's probably going to influence comic book movies in years to come in the quality of it's character development. Brilliant movie=would recommend",James F,5

But just like other message driven movies that have come before This one delivers a harsh truth. You cannot ignore that mental health exists. At one point or another you will come to terms with the consequences of turning a blind eye to the reality around you. I know I may be reaching but this movie is too good to pass. I know for a fact not everyone will enjoy this movie due to how severe mental health might have it's grips in a house hold but it is enough to make you deeply think of how many Jokers there are out there in the world.

I was fixated on this film and couldn't take my eyes off of it. It plays with your heart and mind. It makes you grapple with morality, society, concept of evil, and how society deals with mental illness and the treatment of the mentally ill. It moves like an orchestra and Joker is the conductor. His dancing in the film captures his performance on the Stage of Life. Oscar Wilde said, ""The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast."" I also enjoyed the concept of ""comedy"" and how Joker views ""jokes."" He sees the worst in life as the true comedy and laughs at how he must deal with it in his violence. *Joker laughing* Dr: ""What's so funny?"" Joker : ""I was just thinking about a joke."" *Joker laughing more*",Brymad W,5

22-Dec-19,Absolutely brilliant! It totally absorb you in the world of a mental health patient who is struggling to make a living it lets you see the drama from his angle. It draws attention to modern problems that we are facing in a world that has forgotten those at the bottom of the ladder. Soon or late the society needs to come to term with the reality that ignoring the most vulnerable and poorest in the society will damage us all and pave the way for the next revolution!,Reza Z,5

22-Dec-19,"Am not really all that engrossed in the whole DC/Marvel comic franchises, and my only true knowledge of Batman and the Joker, was through the 60s TV show as a child. However, I wanted to watch this primarily because of the critical acclaim for the performance of Joaquin. And being a bit of a fan of his I have to say the acclaim is totally justified. I picked up on some of the connections with Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, and of course it being set in Gotham City certainly set the mood for something off-the-curve. It was also an incredibly dark, claustrophobic suffocating experience at times, but the film as a whole was engrossing, sad and of course thought-provoking. The violence was all too graphic and surprising, but I guess given the subject matter perhaps it was in keeping with the brooding character close to breaking point. A film I will definitely be watching again, and I hope Joaquin is at least nominated for a Best Actor Oscar: his performance was truly memorable.",Sonny J,4

22-Dec-19,"I finally saw this "" tour de force"". It was okay at best. Where is the shocking plot or story? Where was the Academy worthy acting, oh forgive me his award winning acting was in his weight loss ala real acting like Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis or the weight gain of Charlize Theron. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but this is NOT his best work and the story was a 6/7 out of 10. Joaquin was sooo much better in The Sister Brothers as an actor! The story was on par with this one, but Joaquin Phoenix losing his arm and helpless was awesome! That's where he needs his dues! Joker, 6 out of 10 for long pointless story.",M... M,2
22-Dec-19,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. The cinematography is FANTASTIC, adding more depth to scenes. Joaquin Phoenix MAKES this film amazing.

You've heard everything about the direction, the score, the cinematography, the acting from Phoenix and et al, but the most affecting aspect was simply the film's genius depiction of suffering from mental illness when both the system and society fail to help.

22-Dec-19,"The way I describe this movie is a C minus story with an A plus performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The movie portrayed itself as smarter than it really is. The way that Arthur Fleck is treated by society is completely unbelievable. Just randomly beat up by strangers multiple times for being odd? That seems ridiculous outside of maybe public school.

21-Dec-19,"Solid 4 Stars. I loved the concept and Phoenix did amazing job. He really is a ""once in a lifetime"" type talent. My complaint that it ""borrows"" too much from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. There were parts that were too similar to exact scenes in those movies. I really enjoyed the movie but a little shy of masterpiece. I recommend for comic book fans.",Michael B,4
21-Dec-19,"This new story of Joker is a dark and gripping one. As if The Killing Joke was modelled for our modern social disconcerts. Joaquin Phoenix is unnerving from start to finish. The movie will not let you sit comfortably while you descend into entropy and lawlessness. I think every aspect of the movie were on par in their union, placing the viewers akwardly between empathy and disagreement toward the main character. All in all, it was a great experience.",,5

The film takes some diversions from the comic origins of the Joker but any changes are well warranted. Outstanding efforts from Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro and Todd Phillips. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable film that challenges you to think about what makes a villain.",Kyle G,4.5

The plot was fresh and nice and there were so many good lines of dialogue that I couldn't really dislike any. There will be a lot of memes from this movie. Also Phoenix acted as a top notch actor should.

21-Dec-19,"If an actor does a good job, its actually what I expect an actor to do. No big deal. That J.P. is one of the better actors, yes, we know for some while. (See: ""Beautiful day""). But is Joker a good movie? Is it worth to mention? Is it as big, as media wanted us to believe? Not at all. There is nothing going on, except extraordinary acting. Was there anything special told? Nope. Was there anything happening, that would keep in mind? No. So once again it is a symbol for some incredible stupidity that is going on in todays society, where internet and media behavior is misused for creating opinions. Actually: creating onions. We all know, that in the center of an onion is nothing. its not even worth to get into the senselessviolence discussion, because it is simply not even as violent as they said it would be. But most importand: if I should tell you, what the film is all about, I couldn't tell. The moment I finished it, I already forgot everything. Except that JP is an good actor.",Sina W,0.5

21-Dec-19,"Arthur's lack of validation by any other human drives him into a corner where he begins making violent decisions without remorse. Very depressing, nihilistic and quite dark. The atmosphere and music becomes unbearable in a beautiful way. There is very little release of tension throughout the movie, which provoked me to feel relief when violence finally occurs. The story is much more focused on classism and inequality than I initially expected due to it mostly being discussed as a representation of mental illness. In my opinion, it manages to simultaneously be both a passable and also hugely inaccurate representation of mental illness. By that I mean Arthur's symptoms of anxiety and his dysfunctional coping mechanisms were somewhat realistic (particularly his shaking, as well as the odd and intrusive nature of his daydreams, which took the form of supportive and loving figures for self-validation). However, his violence is not really due to mental illness or delusion. Rather, it is as a result of his philosophical choices and worldview. It left me feeling awful. Because it left me feeling, and I felt its impact ringing in my head for the following days, I rate it highly. Relatively validating, not encouraging. Don't watch when you're feeling down, unless you're okay with feeling worse afterwards.",T L,4.5

21-Dec-19,"Reminiscent of a Scorsese film, this psychological thriller does not feel at all like a comic book movie. Many say that Joaquin Phoenix topped Heath Ledgers' Joker. I would not agree because Joaquin Phoenix does something arguably even harder to pull off- he does a great pre-joker; A great Joker back story. The film is more about a potential origin story for the joker and that is something that would be very hard to do right because the joker is already immortalized as the perfect villain. Creating an origin story could ruin the magic and marvel to the joker, but this film adds to it. Instead of merely explaining where the joker came from, like every other comic book superhero movie has done, this film is only giving you a possible idea of what might have happened. It is absolutely true to the essence of the modern joker, and his performance is intimidating, and in the best of ways. Exactly the temperance you'd expect from the Joker in his youth were you to encounter him on the street. There is also some profound commentary on the state of American society that I did not expect from this film, and it made it go above and beyond. The cinematography and side characters are also appropriately grim and dismally comical. I understand why people wouldn't like it because I understand why people don't like the Joker character or these kind of challenging movies, but I say its a masterpiece and a must-see.",Lucas H,4.5

21-Dec-19,"A bit uneven which is probably why you see a wide range of reviews. The first 45 minutes or so are almost kind of boring but then it kicks into high gear and pays off the setup of the first hour. Phoenix is great both as Arthur, and Joker. I had some issues with his Joker though. Not how he portrayed him, like I said he was great, but there are some personality traits he embraces as the Joker that he showed no hint of as Arthur. It's like he became an entirely different character for the last party of the movie. That character was great, but it wasn't consistent with what had led up to it. For me personally, I still prefer Heath Ledger's Joker, though Phoenix's might be a close second. Like Ledger's, you find yourself at times wondering if that's the same actor behind the paint. I just prefer Ledger's ""Agent of Chaos"" Joker to Phoenix's portrayal which I can't even give a good definition to yet. ""Insanely Sane""? Phoenix will definitely be nominated for the role.",Scott B,4.5

And yes, it needs a followup with Batman. 100%",Goblin R,5

20-Dec-19,"THE PRINCE OF CRIME / Watched it on day one, it's more than two months and I still have goosebumps. The movie isn't that original, isn't something that you haven't seen before, but it's original in its purpose and vision. Todd, Joaquin and the whole working team had made one of the most iconic movies of all time portraying a different and original version of the Joker we all know but he's a metal ill, twisted and a suffering man that tries to be loved, understood, he wants his tears to be dried and he wants to be one of us, but he can't, he knows he can't and for that he'll become something else, choosing a path that himself seems to not accept. Joker earns 5 stars from me, not only because it's a magnificent movie, but because it's easily recognisable and it will stuck in your minds as most of icons movies from the past has done with your mind. Last but not least: Oscar-worthy ? All-in.",Rino B,5
